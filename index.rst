Godot Docs – *master* branch
============================

.. only:: not i18n

  .. note:: Godot's documentation is available in various languages and versions.
            Expand the "Read the Docs" panel at the bottom of the sidebar to see
            the list.

.. only:: i18n

  .. note:: This documentation is translated from the `original English one
            <https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable>`_ by community members
            on `Weblate <https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/godot-engine/godot-docs>`_.

            Depending on the translation effort's completion level, you may
            find paragraphs or whole pages which are still in English. You can
            help the community by providing new translations or reviewing existing
            ones on Weblate.

            For the time being, localized translations are only available for
            the "stable" branch. You can still view the English documentation for
            other engine versions using the "Read the Docs" panel at the bottom
            of the sidebar.

Welcome to the official documentation of `Godot Engine <https://godotengine.org>`__,
the free and open source community-driven 2D and 3D game engine! If you are new
to this documentation, we recommend that you read the
:ref:`introduction page <doc_about_intro>` to get an overview of what this
documentation has to offer.

The table of contents in the sidebar should let you easily access the documentation
for your topic of interest. You can also use the search function in the top-left corner.
