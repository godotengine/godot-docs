.. Intention: only introduce one necessary input method at this point. The
   Inputs section of the docs should provide more guides comparing the various
   tools you have to manage the complexity of user input.

Listening to player input
=========================

Building upon the previous lesson, :ref:`doc_scripting_first_script`, let's look
at another important feature of any game: giving control to the player.
To add this, we need to modify our ``sprite_2d.gd`` code.

.. image:: img/scripting_first_script_moving_with_input.gif

You have two main tools to process the player's input in Godot:

1. The built-in input callbacks, mainly ``_unhandled_input()``. Like
   ``_process()``, it's a built-in virtual function that Godot calls every time
   the player presses a key. It's the tool you want to use to react to events
   that don't happen every frame, like pressing :kbd:`Space` to jump. To learn
   more about input callbacks, see :ref:`doc_inputevent`.
2. The ``Input`` singleton. A singleton is a globally accessible object. Godot
   provides access to several in scripts. It's the right tool to check for input
   every frame.

We're going to use the ``Input`` singleton here as we need to know if the player
wants to turn or move every frame.

For turning, we should use a new variable: ``direction``. In our ``_process()``
function, replace the ``rotation += angular_speed * delta`` line with the
code below.

.. tabs::
 .. code-tab:: gdscript GDScript

    var direction = 0
    if Input.is_action_pressed("ui_left"):
        direction = -1
    if Input.is_action_pressed("ui_right"):
        direction = 1

    rotation += angular_speed * direction * delta

 .. code-tab:: csharp C#

    var direction = 0;
    if (Input.IsActionPressed("ui_left"))
    {
        direction = -1;
    }
    if (Input.IsActionPressed("ui_right"))
    {
        direction = 1;
    }

    Rotation += _angularSpeed * direction * (float)delta;

Our ``direction`` local variable is a multiplier representing the direction in
which the player wants to turn. A value of ``0`` means the player isn't pressing
the left or the right arrow key. A value of ``1`` means the player wants to turn
right, and ``-1`` means they want to turn left.

To produce these values, we introduce conditions and the use of ``Input``. A
condition starts with the ``if`` keyword in GDScript and ends with a colon. The
condition is the expression between the keyword and the end of the line.

To check if a key was pressed this frame, we call ``Input.is_action_pressed()``.
The method takes a text string representing an input action and returns ``true``
if the action is pressed, ``false`` otherwise.

The two actions we use above, "ui_left" and "ui_right", are predefined in every
Godot project. They respectively trigger when the player presses the left and
right arrows on the keyboard or left and right on a gamepad's D-pad.

.. note:: You can see and edit input actions in your project by going to Project
          -> Project Settings and clicking on the Input Map tab.

Finally, we use the ``direction`` as a multiplier when we update the node's
``rotation``: ``rotation += angular_speed * direction * delta``.

Comment out the lines ``var velocity = Vector2.UP.rotated(rotation) * speed`` and ``position += velocity * delta`` like this:

.. tabs::

 .. code-tab:: gdscript GDScript

    #var velocity = Vector2.UP.rotated(rotation) * speed

    #position += velocity * delta

 .. code-tab:: csharp C#

    //var velocity = Vector2.Up.Rotated(Rotation) * _speed;

    //Position += velocity * (float)delta;

This will ignore the code that moved the icon's position in a circle without user input from the previous exercise.

If you run the scene with this code, the icon should rotate when you press
:kbd:`Left` and :kbd:`Right`.

Moving when pressing "up"
-------------------------

To only move when pressing a key, we need to modify the code that calculates the
velocity. Uncomment the code and replace the line starting with ``var velocity`` with the code below.

.. tabs::
 .. code-tab:: gdscript GDScript

    var velocity = Vector2.ZERO
    if Input.is_action_pressed("ui_up"):
        velocity = Vector2.UP.rotated(rotation) * speed

 .. code-tab:: csharp C#

    var velocity = Vector2.Zero;
    if (Input.IsActionPressed("ui_up"))
    {
        velocity = Vector2.Up.Rotated(Rotation) * _speed;
    }

We initialize the ``velocity`` with a value of ``Vector2.ZERO``, another
constant of the built-in ``Vector`` type representing a 2D vector of length 0.

If the player presses the "ui_up" action, we then update the velocity's value,
causing the sprite to move forward.

Complete script
---------------

Here is the complete ``sprite_2d.gd`` file for reference.

.. tabs::
 .. code-tab:: gdscript GDScript

    extends Sprite2D

    var speed = 400
    var angular_speed = PI


    func _process(delta):
        var direction = 0
        if Input.is_action_pressed("ui_left"):
            direction = -1
        if Input.is_action_pressed("ui_right"):
            direction = 1

        rotation += angular_speed * direction * delta

        var velocity = Vector2.ZERO
        if Input.is_action_pressed("ui_up"):
            velocity = Vector2.UP.rotated(rotation) * speed

        position += velocity * delta

 .. code-tab:: csharp C#

    using Godot;

    public partial class MySprite2D : Sprite2D
    {
        private float _speed = 400;
        private float _angularSpeed = Mathf.Pi;

        public override void _Process(double delta)
        {
            var direction = 0;
            if (Input.IsActionPressed("ui_left"))
            {
                direction = -1;
            }
            if (Input.IsActionPressed("ui_right"))
            {
                direction = 1;
            }

            Rotation += _angularSpeed * direction * (float)delta;

            var velocity = Vector2.Zero;
            if (Input.IsActionPressed("ui_up"))
            {
                velocity = Vector2.Up.Rotated(Rotation) * _speed;
            }

            Position += velocity * (float)delta;
        }
    }

If you run the scene, you should now be able to rotate with the left and right
arrow keys and move forward by pressing :kbd:`Up`.

Summary
-------

In summary, every script in Godot represents a class and extends one of the
engine's built-in classes. The node types your classes inherit from give you
access to properties, such as ``rotation`` and ``position`` in our sprite's case.
You also inherit many functions, which we didn't get to use in this example.

In GDScript, the variables you put at the top of the file are your class's
properties, also called member variables. Besides variables, you can define
functions, which, for the most part, will be your classes' methods.

Godot provides several virtual functions you can define to connect your class
with the engine. These include ``_process()``, to apply changes to the node
every frame, and ``_unhandled_input()``, to receive input events like key and
button presses from the users. There are quite a few more.

The ``Input`` singleton allows you to react to the players' input anywhere in
your code. In particular, you'll get to use it in the ``_process()`` loop.

In the next lesson, :ref:`doc_signals`, we'll build upon the relationship between
scripts and nodes by having our nodes trigger code in scripts.
