Learn to code with GDScript
===========================

In Godot, you can write code using the GDScript and C# programming languages.

If you are new to programming, we recommend starting with GDScript because we
designed it to be simpler than all-purpose languages like C#. It will be both
faster and easier to learn.

While GDScript is a language specific to Godot, the techniques you will learn
with it will apply to other programming languages.

Note that it is completely normal for a programmer to learn and use multiple
languages. Programming languages have more similarities than differences, so
once you know one, you can learn another much faster.

Learn in your browser with the GDScript app
-------------------------------------------

To learn GDScript, you can use the app Learn GDScript From Zero. It is a
complete beginner course with interactive practices you can do right in your
