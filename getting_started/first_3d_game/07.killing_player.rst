Killing the player
==================

We can kill enemies by jumping on them, but the player still can't die.
Let's fix this.

We want to detect being hit by an enemy differently from squashing them.
We want the player to die when they're moving on the floor, but not if
they're in the air. We could use vector math to distinguish the two
<<<<<<< HEAD
kinds of collisions. Instead, though, we will use an :ref:`Area3D <class_Area3D>` node, which
=======
kinds of collisions. Instead, though, we will use an *Area* node, which
>>>>>>> ecd1fe77e (Update development/compiling/compiling_for_windows.rst)
works well for hitboxes.

Hitbox with the Area node
-------------------------

<<<<<<< HEAD
Head back to the ``Player.tscn`` scene and add a new child node :ref:`Area3D <class_Area3D>`. Name it
``MobDetector``
Add a :ref:`CollisionShape3D <class_CollisionShape3D>` node as a child of it.
=======
Head back to the *Player* scene and add a new *Area* node. Name it
*MobDetector*. Add a *CollisionShape* node as a child of it.
>>>>>>> ecd1fe77e (Update development/compiling/compiling_for_windows.rst)

|image0|

In the *Inspector*, assign a cylinder shape to it.

|image1|

Here is a trick you can use to make the collisions only happen when the
player is on the ground or close to it. You can reduce the cylinder's
height and move it up to the top of the character. This way, when the
player jumps, the shape will be too high up for the enemies to collide
with it.

|image2|

You also want the cylinder to be wider than the sphere. This way, the
player gets hit before colliding and being pushed on top of the
monster's collision box.

The wider the cylinder, the more easily the player will get killed.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Next, select the ``MobDetector`` node again, and in the *Inspector*, turn
**off** its *Monitorable* property. This makes it so other physics nodes

off its *Monitorable* property. This makes it so other physics nodes
>>>>>>> ecd1fe77e (Update development/compiling/compiling_for_windows.rst)
cannot detect the area. The complementary *Monitoring* property allows
it to detect collisions. Then, remove the *Collision -> Layer* and set
the mask to the "enemies" layer.

|image3|

When areas detect a collision, they emit signals. We're going to connect
<<<<<<< HEAD
one to the ``Player`` node. Select ``MobDetector`` and go to *Inspector*'s *Node* tab, double-click the
``body_entered`` signal and connect it to the ``Player``

|image4|

The *MobDetector* will emit ``body_entered`` when a :ref:`CharacterBody3D <class_CharacterBody3D>` or a
:ref:`RigidBody3D <class_RigidBody3D>` node enters it. As it only masks the "enemies" physics
layers, it will only detect the ``Mob`` nodes.

*RigidBody* node enters it. As it only masks the "enemies" physics

>>>>>>> ecd1fe77e (Update development/compiling/compiling_for_windows.rst)

Code-wise, we're going to do two things: emit a signal we'll later use
to end the game and destroy the player. We can wrap these operations in
a ``die()`` function that helps us put a descriptive label on the code.

.. tabs::
 .. code-tab:: gdscript GDScript

   # Emitted when the player was hit by a mob.
   # Put this at the top of the script.
   signal hit


   # And this function at the bottom.
   func die():
       emit_signal("hit")
       queue_free()


<<<<<<< HEAD
   func _on_mob_detector_body_entered(_body):
=======
   func _on_MobDetector_body_entered(_body):
>>>>>>> ecd1fe77e (Update development/compiling/compiling_for_windows.rst)
       die()

 .. code-tab:: csharp

    // Don't forget to rebuild the project so the editor knows about the new signal.

    // Emitted when the player was hit by a mob.
    [Signal]
    public delegate void HitEventHandler();

    // ...

    private void Die()
    {
        EmitSignal(nameof(Hit));
        QueueFree();
    }

    // We also specified this function name in PascalCase in the editor's connection window
    public void OnMobDetectorBodyEntered(Node body)
    {
        Die();
    }

Try the game again by pressing :kbd:`F5`. If everything is set up correctly,
<<<<<<< HEAD
the character should die when an enemy runs into the collider. Note that without a ``Player``, the following line

.. tabs::
   .. code-tab:: gdscript GDScript

    var player_position = $Player.transform.origin

gives error because there is no $Player!

Also note that the enemy colliding with the player and dying depends on the size and position of the
``Player`` and the ``Mob``\ 's collision shapes. You may need to move them

However, note that this depends entirely on the size and position of the

>>>>>>> ecd1fe77e (Update development/compiling/compiling_for_windows.rst)
and resize them to achieve a tight game feel.

Ending the game
---------------

<<<<<<< HEAD
We can use the ``Player``\ 's ``hit`` signal to end the game. All we need
to do is connect it to the ``Main`` node and stop the ``MobTimer`` in
reaction.

Open ``Main.tscn``, select the ``Player`` node, and in the *Node* dock,
connect its ``hit`` signal to the ``Main`` node.

|image5|

Get the timer, and stop it, in the ``_on_player_hit()`` function.

    {
        GetNode<Timer>("MobTimer").Stop();
    }

If you try the game now, the monsters will stop spawning when you die,
and the remaining ones will leave the screen.

You can pat yourself in the back: you prototyped a complete 3D game,
even if it's still a bit rough.

From there, we'll add a score, the option to retry the game, and you'll
see how you can make the game feel much more alive with minimalistic
animations.
