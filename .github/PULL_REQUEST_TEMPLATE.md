<!--
Please target the `master` branch in priority.
PRs can target other branches (e.g. `3.2`, `3.5`) if the same change was done in `master`, or is not relevant there.
PRs must not target `stable`, as that branch is updated manually.

The type of content accepted into the documentation is explained here:
