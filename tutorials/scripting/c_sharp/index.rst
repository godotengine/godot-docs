C#/.NET
=======

C# is a high-level programming language developed by Microsoft. Godot supports
C# as an option for a scripting language, alongside Godot's own :ref:`GDScript<toc-learn-scripting-gdscript>`.

The standard Godot executable does not contain C# support out of the box. Instead,
to enable C# support for your project you need to `download a .NET version <https://godotengine.org/download/>`_
of the editor from the Godot website.

Godot API for C#
----------------

As a general purpose game engine Godot offers some high-level features as a part
of its API. Articles below explain how these features integrate into C# and how
C# API may be different from GDScript.

C# platform support
-------------------

As of Godot 4.2 projects written in C# support all desktop platforms (Windows, Linux,
and macOS), as well as Android and iOS.

Android support is currently experimental and has a few limitations.

- Projects targeting Android need to target .NET 7.0 or higher. This requires
  modifying the `.csproj` file generated by Godot for existing projects.
  The following property is added to new projects created with 4.2 and can be
  added to existing projects:

  .. code-block:: xml

    <TargetFramework Condition=" '$(GodotTargetPlatform)' == 'android' ">net7.0</TargetFramework>

- Only some Android architectures are supported: ``arm64`` and ``x64``.

iOS support is currently experimental and has a few limitations.

- Projects targeting iOS need to target .NET 8.0 or higher. This requires
  modifying the `.csproj` file generated by Godot for existing projects.
  The following property is added to new projects created with 4.2 and can be
  added to existing projects:

  .. code-block:: xml

    <TargetFramework Condition=" '$(GodotTargetPlatform)' == 'ios' ">net8.0</TargetFramework>

- The official export templates for the iOS simulator only supports the ``x64`` architecture.

- Exporting to iOS can only be done from a MacOS device.

Currently, projects written in C# cannot be exported to the web platform. To use C#
on that platform, consider Godot 3 instead.
