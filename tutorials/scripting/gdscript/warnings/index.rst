GDScript warnings
=================

This is a collection of warnings that GDScript can emit, and information on how to fix the code that causes them.

.. note::
   The list of warnings is currently incomplete. We hope to add pages for more warnings over time, so that each one can be thoroughly reviewed for correctness and clarity.
