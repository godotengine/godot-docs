GDExtension Internals
=====================

This section is aimed at people who want to make a new GDExtension from scratch. This is mainly people creating new language bindings.

If you're looking to make a Godot extension with existing language bindings, check out the :ref:`C++ documentation (godot-cpp) <doc_gdextension_docs_system>`, or documentations for :ref:`other languages <doc_what_is_gdextension>` instead.
