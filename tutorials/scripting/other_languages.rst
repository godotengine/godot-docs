The Godot developers officially support the following languages for Godot:

- :ref:`GDScript (all versions)<doc_gdscript>`
- :ref:`C# (.NET version)<doc_c_sharp>`
- :ref:`C++ (via GDExtension) <doc_godot_cpp>`

.. note::

    There are no plans to support additional languages officially.
    That said, the community offers several bindings for other languages (see below).
