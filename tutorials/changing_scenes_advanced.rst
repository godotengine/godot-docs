Introduction
============

| Changing a scene in Godot is not often as straightforward, this is due
  to the high flexibility offered by the scene system. As there is
  nothing that really defines a "loaded scene", this must be done
  manually.
| The advantage of this is that it's easy to handle different common
  situations, such as loading screens (with progress bar), transitions
  (fadeins/fadeouts), preloaded scenes, etc.
