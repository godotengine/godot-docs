Blender ESCN exporter
=====================

To export from Blender to Godot 4.x, use one of the 
:ref:`available 3D formats <doc_importing_3d_scenes_available_formats>`.

The plugin `Godot Blender Exporter <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-blender-exporter>`__ 
is not maintained or supported in Godot 4.x. While not officially supported, the plugin may 
partially work for some Godot and Blender versions, particularly before Blender version 4.0.
For complete docs on the Blender exporter, see the 
`previous version of this page <https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.0/tutorials/assets_pipeline/escn_exporter/index.html>`__.
