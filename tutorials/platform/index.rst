Platform-specific
=================

Godot supports both running the editor and exporting projects on several
platforms. Usage of the engine is generally similar across platforms, but there
are some platform-specific considerations, which are covered in this section.

   For platform-specific versions of the editor, see :ref:`doc_using_the_xr_editor`,
   :ref:`doc_using_the_android_editor`, and :ref:`doc_using_the_web_editor`. For
   exporting to specific platforms, see the :ref:`doc_export_index` section.
