Exporting for visionOS
======================

.. seealso::

    This page describes how to export a Godot project to visionOS.
    If you're looking to compile export template binaries from source instead,
    see :ref:`doc_compiling_for_visionos`.

Exporting instructions for visionOS are currently identical to
:ref:`doc_compiling_for_ios`, except you should add a **visionOS**
export preset instead of **iOS**. See the linked page for details.

.. note::

    Note that currently, only exporting an application for use on a flat
    plane within the headset is supported. Immersive experiences are not supported.
