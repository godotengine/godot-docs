Godot includes a dedicated 2D renderer and 2D physics engine, as well as
2D-specific features like tilemaps, particles, and animation systems. This
section covers most 2D-specific topics in Godot.

For 2D topics not covered in this section, see also :ref:`doc_2d_skeletons` and
:ref:`doc_navigation_overview_2d`. For using physics in 2D, see
:ref:`doc_physics_index`. There is also a step-by-step tutorial on creating a 2D
game in :ref:`doc_your_first_2d_game`.
