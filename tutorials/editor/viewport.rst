Viewport
--------

Viewport is the large area located at the editor's center where 2D nodes can be displayed 
and 3D nodes can be rendered. The viewport with its toolbar is covered separately in 2D 
and 3D introductory pages:

- Viewport in 2D
- For the viewport in 3D, see :ref:`doc_introduction_to_3d`.

Depending on the selected node, additional tools can be visible.
For example, curve drawing tools for `Path2D`, or Mesh tools for `MeshInstance3D`.

.. note:: To learn more about the ``Viewport`` class itself, see: 
  :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>`.
