Core features
=============

Godot is built around a few core features: Nodes, Scenes, Signals, and Resources.
This section describes how to best make use of these features.

For a general introduction to the engine and these concepts, you may want to
read through the :ref:`Getting Started <doc_getting_started_intro>` section first.
