Visual Scripting
================

Introduction
------------

Visual Scripting is a controversial topic, with many misunderstandings.
Programmers often think the aim of Visual Scripting is to replace their beloved code.
Artists and Game Designers tend to think that they can write any game they want with
little effort without the need of programmers.

This situation is the result of really bad marketing from many products over time 
which, in their aim to capture the interest of Artists and Game Designers, also
made programmers feel like they are being replaced by visual tools.

Truth is mostly, somewhat, in the middle.

First of all, programmers can rest assured that Visual Scripting in no way makes
code obsolete. Artists and Game Designers can also rest assured that they will be
able to do a lot of things without programming.

Visual Scripting is a tool designed to make the entry barrier to programming
much lower. As code is more visual, it needs less abstract thinking to be
understood. Any Artist, Animator, Game Designer, etc. can look at it and quickly
grasp the flow of logic.

The reason it does not make existing programming obsolete is, simply, that it does not scale as well.
It takes considerably more time to create code with it, and it's often more difficult
to modify than just writing a few characters.

With the misunderstanding cleared up, the question that remains is what are the practical
uses for Visual Scripting.

The most common use cases are are as follows:

* Beginners starting game development who want to learn an engine but have no programming experience yet.
* Artists and Game Designers who have no experience in programming and want to create quick prototypes or simple games.
* Programmers working in a team that want to make part of the game logic available to Artists or Game Designers in order to offload some of their work.

These scenarios are far more common than one might think, so this is why Godot has added this feature.
