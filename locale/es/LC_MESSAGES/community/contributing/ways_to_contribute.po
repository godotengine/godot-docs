"Godot Engine is a non-profit, community-driven free and open source "
"project. Almost all (but our lead dev Juan, more on that below) "
"developers are working *pro bono* on their free time, out of personal "
"interest and for the love of creating a libre engine of exceptional "
"quality."

"This means that to thrive, Godot needs as many users as possible to get "
"involved by contributing to the engine. There are many ways to contribute"
" to such a big project, making it possible for everybody to bring "
"something positive to the engine, regardless of their skill set:"

"**Be part of the community.** The best way to contribute to Godot and "
"help it become ever better is simply to use the engine and promote it by "
"word-of-mouth, in the credits or splash screen of your games, blog posts,"
" tutorials, videos, demos, gamedev or free software events, support on "
"the Q&A, IRC, forums, Discord, etc. Participate! Being a user and "
"advocate helps spread the word about our great engine, which has no "
"marketing budget and can therefore only rely on its community to become "
"more mainstream."

"**Make games.** It's no secret that, to convince new users and especially"
" the industry at large that Godot is a relevant market player, we need "
"great games made with Godot. We know that the engine has a lot of "
"potential, both for 2D and 3D games, but given its young age we still "
"lack big releases that will draw attention to Godot. So keep working on "
"your awesome projects, each new game increases our credibility on the "
"gamedev market!"

"**Get involved in the engine's development.** This can be by contributing"
" code via pull requests, testing the development snapshots or directly "
"the git *master* branch, report bugs or suggest enhancements on the issue"
" tracker, improve the official documentation (both the class reference "
"and tutorials). The following sections will cover each of those "
"\"direct\" ways of contributing to the engine."

"**Donate.** Godot is a non-profit project, but it can still benefit from "
"user donations for many things. Apart from usual expenses such as hosting"
" costs or promotion material on events, we also use donation money to "
"acquire hardware when necessary (e.g. we used donation money to buy a "
"Macbook Pro to implement Retina/HiDPI support and various other macOS-"
"related features). Most importantly, we also used donation money to hire "
"our lead developer Juan Linietsky, so that he can work full-time on the "
"engine. Even with a low monthly wage, we need a steady donation income to"
" continue doing this, which has been very beneficial to the project so "
"far. So if you want to donate some money to the project, check `our "
"website <http://godotengine.org/donate>`_ for details."

"make a demo project that reproduces this issue out of the box, zip it and"
" attach it to the issue (you can do this by drag and drop). Even if you "
"think that the issue is trivial to reproduce, adding a minimal project "
"that lets reproduce it is a big added value. You have to keep in mind "
