"The Godot Asset Library, otherwise known as the AssetLib, is a repository"
" of user-submitted Godot addons, scripts, tools and other resources, "
"collectively referred to as assets. They're available to all Godot users "
"for download directly from within the engine, but it can also be accessed"
" at Godot's `official website <https://godotengine.org/asset-library>`_."

"On the surface the Asset Library might look and function similar to asset"
" stores available for other engines, such as Unity's Asset Store, or "
"Unreal Engine's Marketplace, where you can submit both freely-available "
"assets, as well as paid, commercial ones. In addition, often times such "
"assets are distributed under non-free, proprietary licenses, limiting "
"what you can do with them."

"The Asset Library is different - all assets are distributed free of "
"charge, and under a host of open-source licenses (such as the MIT "
"license, the GPL, and the Boost Software License). This makes the "
"AssetLib more similar to the software repositories of a Linux "
"distribution."

"This set of pages will cover how to use the AssetLib (both from inside "
"Godot, and on the website), how you can submit your own assets, and what "
"the guidelines for submission are."

"Please note that the AssetLib is relatively young - it may have various "
"pain points, bugs and usability issues. As with all Godot projects, the "
"code repository is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/godotengine"
"/asset-library>`_, where you can submit pull requests and issues, so "
"please do not hesitate to visit it!"
