"Before continuing, it must be noted that the *Node* terminology needs to "
"be used with care. When referring to *Visual Script Nodes* (or generally "
"*Nodes*) this text will refer to the little boxes you connect with lines,"
" which are part of a graph. When referring to *Scene Nodes*, it is "
"implied that the elements that make up a Scene are being referred, which "
"are part of a tree. Their naming is similar but their function is "
"different. When referring to *Node* here, it will be implied that a "
"*Visual Script Node* is referred to unless indicated otherwise."

msgstr ""

#: ../../getting_started/scripting/visual_script/nodes_purposes.rst:40
msgid ""
"*Sequence Ports* indicate the order in which operations are executed. "
"Typically when a *Node* is done processing, it will go to the next node "
"from one of the ports at the right. If nothing is connected the function "
"may end, or another output *Sequence Port* might be tried (this depends "
