"As with everything in Godot, we prioritize a good experience over copying"

"In fact, Visual Scripting integrates so well to Godot that it's hard to "

"the rest of Godot panels and docks act like a palette from where you can "
"drag and drop all sorts of information to the script canvas:"

"Unlike other visual scripting implementations, Visual Scripting in Godot "

"The last way to create functions is to do it manually. In general this is"
