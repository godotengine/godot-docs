"**Every game engine is different and fits different needs.** Not only do "
"they offer a range of features, the design of each engine is unique. This"
" leads to different workflows and different ways to form your games’ "
"structures. This all stems from their respective design philosophies."

"This page is here to help you understand how Godot works, starting with "
"some of its core pillars. It is not a list of available features, nor is "
"it an engine comparison. To know if any engine can be a good fit for your"
" project, you need to try it out for yourself and understand its design "
"and limitations."

"Godot embraces object-oriented design at its core with its flexible scene"

"For one, Godot lets you **compose or aggregate** scenes. It's like nested"
" prefabs: you can create a BlinkingLight scene and a BrokenLantern scene "
"that uses the BlinkingLight. Then, create a city filled with "
"BrokenLanterns. Change the BlinkingLight's color, save, and all the "
"BrokenLanterns in the city will update instantly."

msgid ""
"A Godot scene could be a Weapon, a Character, an Item, a Door, a Level, "
"part of a level… anything you’d like. It works like a class in pure code "
"except you’re free to design it by using the editor, using only the code,"
" or mixing and matching the two."

#: ../../getting_started/step_by_step/godot_design_philosophy.rst:40

"It’s different from prefabs you find in several 3D engines as you can "
"then inherit from and extend those scenes. You may create a Magician that"
" extends your Character. Modify the Character in the editor and the "
"Magician will update as well. It helps you build your projects so that "
"their structure matches the game’s design."
