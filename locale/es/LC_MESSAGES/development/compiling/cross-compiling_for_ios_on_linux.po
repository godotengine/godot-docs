"While it is possible to compile for iOS on a Linux environment, Apple is "
"very restrictive about the tools to be used (especially hardware-wise), "
"allowing pretty much only their products to be used for development. So "
"this is **not official**. However, a `statement from Apple in 2010 "
"<http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/09/09Statement-by-Apple-on-App-"
"Store-Review-Guidelines.html>`__ says they relaxed some of the `App Store"
" review guidelines <https://developer.apple.com/app-"
"store/review/guidelines/>`__ to allow any tool to be used, as long as the"
" resulting binary does not download any code, which means it should be OK"
" to use the procedure described here and cross-compiling the binary."
