Contributing
============

Everyone is most welcome to contribute to Godot. Here are some ways in which you
can contribute to the project:

- Improving the engine by fixing bugs, coding new features, or refining existing ones.
- Writing or proofreading documentation. You can contribute both to this
  reference manual or the code reference.
- Translating the editor or documentation from English to other languages.
- Reporting issues or `writing detailed proposals
  <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/>`__.

Writing documentation

We always need help to improve the documentation, be it the class reference or
the manual. Below, you can find our content and writing guidelines and
concrete guides to make changes to the documentation.

Guidelines

Class reference guides
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The pages below focus on the class reference.

As the reference is included in the Godot editor, its source files are part of
the `godot repository <https://github.com/godotengine/godot>`_. We use XML files
to write it, so the process to contribute to the class reference differs from
writing the online manual.

Translating the documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The community is always working hard on making Godot and its documentation
available to more people. Localizing the documentation is a colossal and ongoing
effort you can be part of.
