Where to start
--------------

The Godot video tutorials by `GDQuest <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxboW7x0jZqFdvMdCFKTMsQ/playlists>`_ are well-regarded in the community and often recommended as a gentle introduction to beginners.

GDQuest's *Learn GDScript From Zero* is a free and open source interactive tutorial for absolute beginners to learn to program with Godot's GDScript language. It is available as a `desktop application <https://gdquest.itch.io/learn-godot-gdscript>`_  or `in the browser <https://gdquest.github.io/learn-gdscript>`_.

Some tutorials mentioned below cover more advanced subjects, e.g. on 3D or shaders.
