List of features
================

This page aims to list **all** features currently supported by Godot.

.. note::

    This page lists features supported by the current stable version of
    Godot. Some of these features are not available in the
    `3.x release series <https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.6/about/list_of_features.html>`__.

Platforms
---------

.. seealso::

    See :ref:`doc_system_requirements` for hardware and software version requirements.

**Can run both the editor and exported projects:**

- Windows (x86 and ARM, 64-bit and 32-bit).
- macOS (x86 and ARM, 64-bit only).
- Linux (x86 and ARM, 64-bit and 32-bit).

   - Binaries are statically linked and can run on any distribution if compiled
     on an old enough base distribution.
   - Official binaries are compiled using the
     `Godot Engine buildroot <https://github.com/godotengine/buildroot>`__,
     allowing for binaries that work across common Linux distributions.

- :ref:`Web browsers <doc_using_the_web_editor>`. Experimental in 4.0,
  using Godot 3.x is recommended instead when targeting HTML5.

**Runs exported projects:**

- iOS.
- :ref:`Consoles <doc_consoles>`.

Godot aims to be as platform-independent as possible and can be
:ref:`ported to new platforms <doc_custom_platform_ports>` with relative ease.

.. note::

    Projects written in C# using Godot 4 currently cannot be exported to the
    web platform. To use C# on that platform, consider Godot 3 instead.
    Android and iOS platform support is available as of Godot 4.2, but is
    experimental and :ref:`some limitations apply <doc_c_sharp_platforms>`.

  features). The most advanced graphics backend, suited for desktop platforms
  only. Used by default on desktop platforms.
- **Forward Mobile**, running over Vulkan 1.0 (with optional Vulkan 1.1 and 1.2
  features). Less features, but renders simple scenes faster. Suited for mobile
  and desktop platforms. Used by default on mobile platforms.
- **Compatibility**, running over OpenGL 3.3 / OpenGL ES 3.0 / WebGL 2.0. The least
  advanced graphics backend, suited for low-end desktop and mobile platforms.
  Used by default on the web platform.

See :ref:`doc_renderers` for a detailed comparison of the rendering methods.

2D graphics

  Clustered rendering also lifts any limits on the number of lights that can be used on a mesh.
- When using the Forward Mobile backend, up to 8 omni lights and 8 spot lights can
  be displayed per mesh resource. Baked lighting can be used to overcome this limit
  if needed.

  and normal mapping.
- Texture channels are smoothly overlaid on top of the underlying material,
  with support for normal/ORM-only decals.
- Support for normal fade to fade the decal depending on its incidence angle.
- Does not rely on runtime mesh generation. This means decals can be used on

Godot's small distribution size can make it a suitable alternative to frameworks
like Electron or Qt.

Animation
---------

- Direct kinematics and inverse kinematics.
- Support for animating any property with customizable interpolation.
- Support for calling methods in animation tracks.
- Support for playing sounds in animation tracks.
- Support for Bézier curves in animation.

File formats
------------

- Scenes and resources can be saved in :ref:`text-based <doc_tscn_file_format>` or binary formats.

   - Text-based formats are human-readable and more friendly to version control.
   - Binary formats are faster to save/load for large scenes/resources.

- Read and write text or binary files using :ref:`class_FileAccess`.

   - Can optionally be compressed or encrypted.

- Read and write :ref:`class_JSON` files.
- Read and write INI-style configuration files using :ref:`class_ConfigFile`.

   - Can (de)serialize any Godot datatype, including Vector2/3, Color, ...

- Read XML files using :ref:`class_XMLParser`.
- :ref:`Load and save images, audio/video, fonts and ZIP archives <doc_runtime_loading_and_saving>`
  in an exported project without having to go through Godot's import system.
- Pack game data into a PCK file (custom format optimized for fast seeking),
  into a ZIP archive, or directly into the executable for single-file distribution.
- :ref:`Export additional PCK files<doc_exporting_pcks>` that can be read
  by the engine to support mods and DLCs.

Miscellaneous
-------------

- :ref:`Video playback <doc_playing_videos>` with built-in support for Ogg Theora.
- :ref:`Movie Maker mode <doc_creating_movies>` to record videos from a running
  project with synchronized audio and perfect frame pacing.
- :ref:`Low-level access to servers <doc_using_servers>` which allows bypassing
  the scene tree's overhead when needed.
- :ref:`Command line interface <doc_command_line_tutorial>` for automation.

   - Export and deploy projects using continuous integration platforms.
   - `Shell completion scripts <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/tree/master/misc/dist/shell>`__
     are available for Bash, zsh and fish.
   - Print colored text to standard output on all platforms using
     :ref:`print_rich <class_@GlobalScope_method_print_rich>`.

- Support for :ref:`C++ modules <doc_custom_modules_in_cpp>` statically linked
  into the engine binary.
- Engine and editor written in C++17.

   - Can be :ref:`compiled <doc_introduction_to_the_buildsystem>` using GCC,
     Clang and MSVC. MinGW is also supported.
   - Friendly towards packagers. In most cases, system libraries can be used
     instead of the ones provided by Godot. The build system doesn't download anything.
     Builds can be fully reproducible.

- Licensed under the permissive MIT license.

   - Open development process with :ref:`contributions welcome <doc_ways_to_contribute>`.
