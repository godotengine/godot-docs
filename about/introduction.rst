        print("Hello world!")

Welcome to the official documentation of **Godot Engine**, the free and open source
community-driven 2D and 3D game engine! Behind this mouthful, you will find a
powerful yet user-friendly tool that you can use to develop any kind of game,
for any platform and with no usage restriction whatsoever.

This page gives a broad overview of the engine and of this documentation,
so that you know where to start if you are a beginner or
where to look if you need information on a specific feature.

Before you start
----------------

The :ref:`Tutorials and resources <doc_community_tutorials>` page lists
video tutorials contributed by the community. If you prefer video to text,
consider checking them out. Otherwise, :ref:`Getting Started <doc_getting_started_intro>`
is a great starting point.

In case you have trouble with one of the tutorials or your project,
you can find help on the various :ref:`Community channels <doc_community_channels>`,
especially the Godot `Discord`_ community and
`Forum <https://forum.godotengine.org/>`_.

About Godot Engine
------------------

A game engine is a complex tool and difficult to present in a few words.
Here's a quick synopsis, which you are free to reuse
if you need a quick write-up about Godot Engine:

    Godot Engine is a feature-packed, cross-platform game engine to create 2D
    and 3D games from a unified interface. It provides a comprehensive set of
    common tools, so that users can focus on making games without having to
    reinvent the wheel. Games can be exported with one click to a number of
    platforms, including the major desktop platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows),
    mobile platforms (Android, iOS), as well as Web-based platforms and consoles.

    Godot is completely free and open source under the :ref:`permissive MIT
    license <doc_complying_with_licenses>`. No strings attached, no royalties,
    nothing. Users' games are theirs, down to the last line of engine code.
    Godot's development is fully independent and community-driven, empowering
    users to help shape their engine to match their expectations.
    It is supported by the `Godot Foundation <https://godot.foundation/>`_
    not-for-profit.
