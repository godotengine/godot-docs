Class representing a square mesh facing the camera.

Description
-----------

Class representing a square :ref:`PrimitiveMesh<class_PrimitiveMesh>`. This flat mesh does not have a thickness. By default, this mesh is aligned on the X and Y axes; this rotation is more suited for use with billboarded materials. A **QuadMesh** is equivalent to a :ref:`PlaneMesh<class_PlaneMesh>` except its default :ref:`PlaneMesh.orientation<class_PlaneMesh_property_orientation>` is :ref:`PlaneMesh.FACE_Z<class_PlaneMesh_constant_FACE_Z>`.
