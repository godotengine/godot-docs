Handle for a :ref:`Resource<class_Resource>`'s unique ID.

Description

The RID type is used to access the unique integer ID of a resource. They are opaque, which means they do not grant access to the associated resource by themselves. They are used by and with the low-level Server classes such as :ref:`VisualServer<class_VisualServer>`.
