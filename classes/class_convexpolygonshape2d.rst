ConvexPolygonShape2D
====================

**Inherits:** :ref:`Shape2D<class_Shape2D>` **<** :ref:`Resource<class_Resource>` **<** :ref:`RefCounted<class_RefCounted>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

A 2D convex polygon shape used for physics collision.

.. rst-class:: classref-introduction-group

Description
-----------

A 2D convex polygon shape, intended for use in physics. Used internally in :ref:`CollisionPolygon2D<class_CollisionPolygon2D>` when it's in :ref:`CollisionPolygon2D.BUILD_SOLIDS<class_CollisionPolygon2D_constant_BUILD_SOLIDS>` mode.

\ **ConvexPolygonShape2D** is *solid*, which means it detects collisions from objects that are fully inside it, unlike :ref:`ConcavePolygonShape2D<class_ConcavePolygonShape2D>` which is hollow. This makes it more suitable for both detection and physics.

\ **Convex decomposition:** A concave polygon can be split up into several convex polygons. This allows dynamic physics bodies to have complex concave collisions (at a performance cost) and can be achieved by using several **ConvexPolygonShape2D** nodes or by using the :ref:`CollisionPolygon2D<class_CollisionPolygon2D>` node in :ref:`CollisionPolygon2D.BUILD_SOLIDS<class_CollisionPolygon2D_constant_BUILD_SOLIDS>` mode. To generate a collision polygon from a sprite, select the :ref:`Sprite2D<class_Sprite2D>` node, go to the **Sprite2D** menu that appears above the viewport, and choose **Create Polygon2D Sibling**.

\ **Performance:** **ConvexPolygonShape2D** is faster to check collisions against compared to :ref:`ConcavePolygonShape2D<class_ConcavePolygonShape2D>`, but it is slower than primitive collision shapes such as :ref:`CircleShape2D<class_CircleShape2D>` and :ref:`RectangleShape2D<class_RectangleShape2D>`. Its use should generally be limited to medium-sized objects that cannot have their collision accurately represented by primitive shapes.

Property Descriptions
---------------------

.. _class_ConvexPolygonShape2D_property_points:

.. rst-class:: classref-property

:ref:`PackedVector2Array<class_PackedVector2Array>` **points** = ``PackedVector2Array()`` :ref:`ðŸ”—<class_ConvexPolygonShape2D_property_points>`

.. rst-class:: classref-property-setget

- |void| **set_points**\ (\ value\: :ref:`PackedVector2Array<class_PackedVector2Array>`\ )
- :ref:`PackedVector2Array<class_PackedVector2Array>` **get_points**\ (\ )

The polygon's list of vertices that form a convex hull. Can be in either clockwise or counterclockwise order.

\ **Warning:** Only set this property to a list of points that actually form a convex hull. Use :ref:`set_point_cloud<class_ConvexPolygonShape2D_method_set_point_cloud>` to generate the convex hull of an arbitrary set of points.

**Note:** The returned array is *copied* and any changes to it will not update the original property value. See :ref:`PackedVector2Array<class_PackedVector2Array>` for more details.

Method Descriptions
-------------------

.. _class_ConvexPolygonShape2D_method_set_point_cloud:

.. rst-class:: classref-method

|void| **set_point_cloud**\ (\ point_cloud\: :ref:`PackedVector2Array<class_PackedVector2Array>`\ ) :ref:`ðŸ”—<class_ConvexPolygonShape2D_method_set_point_cloud>`

Based on the set of points provided, this assigns the :ref:`points<class_ConvexPolygonShape2D_property_points>` property using the convex hull algorithm, removing all unneeded points. See :ref:`Geometry2D.convex_hull<class_Geometry2D_method_convex_hull>` for details.
