VisualShaderNodeVectorDecompose
===============================

**Inherits:** :ref:`VisualShaderNodeVectorBase<class_VisualShaderNodeVectorBase>` **<** :ref:`VisualShaderNode<class_VisualShaderNode>` **<** :ref:`Resource<class_Resource>` **<** :ref:`RefCounted<class_RefCounted>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

Decomposes a :ref:`Vector2<class_Vector2>`, :ref:`Vector3<class_Vector3>` or 4D vector (represented as a :ref:`Quaternion<class_Quaternion>`) into scalars within the visual shader graph.

Description
-----------

Takes a ``vec2``, ``vec3`` or ``vec4`` and decomposes it into scalar values that can be used as separate outputs.

.. |virtual| replace:: :abbr:`virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`
.. |const| replace:: :abbr:`const (This method has no side effects. It doesn't modify any of the instance's member variables.)`
.. |vararg| replace:: :abbr:`vararg (This method accepts any number of arguments after the ones described here.)`
.. |constructor| replace:: :abbr:`constructor (This method is used to construct a type.)`
.. |static| replace:: :abbr:`static (This method doesn't need an instance to be called, so it can be called directly using the class name.)`
.. |operator| replace:: :abbr:`operator (This method describes a valid operator to use with this type as left-hand operand.)`
.. |bitfield| replace:: :abbr:`BitField (This value is an integer composed as a bitmask of the following flags.)`
.. |void| replace:: :abbr:`void (No return value.)`
