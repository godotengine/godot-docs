**Inherits:** :ref:`VisualShaderNode<class_VisualShaderNode>` **<** :ref:`Resource<class_Resource>` **<** :ref:`RefCounted<class_RefCounted>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

Outputs a 3D vector based on the result of a floating point comparison within the visual shader graph.

Description
-----------

This visual shader node has six input ports. Port 1 and 2 provide the two floating point numbers ``a`` and ``b`` that will be compared. Port 3 is the tolerance, which allows similar floating point number to be considered equal. Ports 4 to 6 are the possible outputs, returned if ``a == b``, ``a > b``, or ``a < b`` respectively.
