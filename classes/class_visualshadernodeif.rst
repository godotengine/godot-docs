VisualShaderNodeIf
==================

**Inherits:** :ref:`VisualShaderNode<class_VisualShaderNode>` **<** :ref:`Resource<class_Resource>` **<** :ref:`RefCounted<class_RefCounted>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

Outputs a 3D vector based on the result of a floating-point comparison within the visual shader graph.

Description
-----------

This visual shader node has six input ports:

- Port **1** and **2** provide the two floating-point numbers ``a`` and ``b`` that will be compared.

- Port **3** is the tolerance, which allows similar floating-point numbers to be considered equal.

- Ports **4**, **5**, and **6** are the possible outputs, returned if ``a == b``, ``a > b``, or ``a < b`` respectively.
