Blends two animations linearly inside of an :ref:`AnimationNodeBlendTree<class_AnimationNodeBlendTree>`.

Description
-----------

A resource to add to an :ref:`AnimationNodeBlendTree<class_AnimationNodeBlendTree>`. Blends two animations linearly based on the amount value.

In general, the blend value should be in the ``[0.0, 1.0]`` range. Values outside of this range can blend amplified or inverted animations, however, :ref:`AnimationNodeAdd2<class_AnimationNodeAdd2>` works better for this purpose.
