A 2D physics body that can't be moved by external forces. When moved manually, it doesn't affect other bodies in its path.

Description
-----------

A static 2D physics body. It can't be moved by external forces or contacts, but can be moved manually by other means such as code, :ref:`AnimationMixer<class_AnimationMixer>`\ s (with :ref:`AnimationMixer.callback_mode_process<class_AnimationMixer_property_callback_mode_process>` set to :ref:`AnimationMixer.ANIMATION_CALLBACK_MODE_PROCESS_PHYSICS<class_AnimationMixer_constant_ANIMATION_CALLBACK_MODE_PROCESS_PHYSICS>`), and :ref:`RemoteTransform2D<class_RemoteTransform2D>`.

When **StaticBody2D** is moved, it is teleported to its new position without affecting other physics bodies in its path. If this is not desired, use :ref:`AnimatableBody2D<class_AnimatableBody2D>` instead.

\ **StaticBody2D** is useful for completely static objects like floors and walls, as well as moving surfaces like conveyor belts and circular revolving platforms (by using :ref:`constant_linear_velocity<class_StaticBody2D_property_constant_linear_velocity>` and :ref:`constant_angular_velocity<class_StaticBody2D_property_constant_angular_velocity>`).

.. _class_StaticBody2D_property_constant_angular_velocity:

.. rst-class:: classref-property

:ref:`float<class_float>` **constant_angular_velocity** = ``0.0`` :ref:`ðŸ”—<class_StaticBody2D_property_constant_angular_velocity>`

.. rst-class:: classref-property-setget

- |void| **set_constant_angular_velocity**\ (\ value\: :ref:`float<class_float>`\ )
- :ref:`float<class_float>` **get_constant_angular_velocity**\ (\ )

The body's constant angular velocity. This does not rotate the body, but affects touching bodies, as if it were rotating.

.. rst-class:: classref-property

:ref:`Vector2<class_Vector2>` **constant_linear_velocity** = ``Vector2(0, 0)`` :ref:`ðŸ”—<class_StaticBody2D_property_constant_linear_velocity>`

.. rst-class:: classref-property-setget

- |void| **set_constant_linear_velocity**\ (\ value\: :ref:`Vector2<class_Vector2>`\ )
- :ref:`Vector2<class_Vector2>` **get_constant_linear_velocity**\ (\ )

The body's constant linear velocity. This does not move the body, but affects touching bodies, as if it were moving.

.. _class_StaticBody2D_property_physics_material_override:

.. rst-class:: classref-property

:ref:`PhysicsMaterial<class_PhysicsMaterial>` **physics_material_override** :ref:`ðŸ”—<class_StaticBody2D_property_physics_material_override>`

.. rst-class:: classref-property-setget

- |void| **set_physics_material_override**\ (\ value\: :ref:`PhysicsMaterial<class_PhysicsMaterial>`\ )
- :ref:`PhysicsMaterial<class_PhysicsMaterial>` **get_physics_material_override**\ (\ )

The physics material override for the body.

If a material is assigned to this property, it will be used instead of any other physics material, such as an inherited one.

.. |virtual| replace:: :abbr:`virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`
.. |const| replace:: :abbr:`const (This method has no side effects. It doesn't modify any of the instance's member variables.)`
.. |vararg| replace:: :abbr:`vararg (This method accepts any number of arguments after the ones described here.)`
.. |constructor| replace:: :abbr:`constructor (This method is used to construct a type.)`
.. |static| replace:: :abbr:`static (This method doesn't need an instance to be called, so it can be called directly using the class name.)`
