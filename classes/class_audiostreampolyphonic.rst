Description
-----------

AudioStream that lets the user play custom streams at any time from code, simultaneously using a single player.

Playback control is done via the :ref:`AudioStreamPlaybackPolyphonic<class_AudioStreamPlaybackPolyphonic>` instance set inside the player, which can be obtained via :ref:`AudioStreamPlayer.get_stream_playback<class_AudioStreamPlayer_method_get_stream_playback>`, :ref:`AudioStreamPlayer2D.get_stream_playback<class_AudioStreamPlayer2D_method_get_stream_playback>` or :ref:`AudioStreamPlayer3D.get_stream_playback<class_AudioStreamPlayer3D_method_get_stream_playback>` methods. Obtaining the playback instance is only valid after the ``stream`` property is set as an **AudioStreamPolyphonic** in those players.
