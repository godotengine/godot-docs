===========

**Inherits:** :ref:`RefCounted<class_RefCounted>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

Description
-----------

This abstract class helps connect the :ref:`Node3D<class_Node3D>` scene with the editor-specific :ref:`EditorNode3DGizmo<class_EditorNode3DGizmo>` class.

\ **Node3DGizmo** by itself has no exposed API, refer to :ref:`Node3D.add_gizmo<class_Node3D_method_add_gizmo>` and pass it an :ref:`EditorNode3DGizmo<class_EditorNode3DGizmo>` instance.
