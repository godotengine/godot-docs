========

**Inherits:** :ref:`Joint<class_joint>` **<** :ref:`Spatial<class_spatial>` **<** :ref:`Node<class_node>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_object>`

**Category:** Core

Brief Description
-----------------

Pin Joint for 3D Shapes.

Member Variables
----------------

  .. _class_PinJoint_params/bias:

- :ref:`float<class_float>` **params/bias** - The force with wich the pinned objects stay in positional relation to each other.

The higher, the stronger.

  .. _class_PinJoint_params/damping:

- :ref:`float<class_float>` **params/damping** - The force with wich the pinned objects stay in velocity relation to each other.

The higher, the stronger.

  .. _class_PinJoint_params/impulse_clamp:

- :ref:`float<class_float>` **params/impulse_clamp** - If above 0, this value is the maximum value for an impulse that this Joint produces.


Numeric Constants
-----------------

- **PARAM_BIAS** = **0** --- The force with wich the pinned objects stay in positional relation to each other.

The higher, the stronger.
- **PARAM_DAMPING** = **1** --- The force with wich the pinned objects stay in velocity relation to each other.

The higher, the stronger.
- **PARAM_IMPULSE_CLAMP** = **2** --- If above 0, this value is the maximum value for an impulse that this Joint produces.

Description
-----------

Pin Joint for 3D Rigid Bodies. It pins 2 bodies (rigid or static) together.
