Description
-----------

The PointMesh is made from a single point. Instead of relying on triangles, points are rendered as a single rectangle on the screen with a constant size. They are intended to be used with Particle systems, but can be used as a cheap way to render constant size billboarded sprites (for example in a point cloud).

PointMeshes, must be used with a material that has a point size. Point size can be accessed in a shader with ``POINT_SIZE``, or in a :ref:`SpatialMaterial<class_SpatialMaterial>` by setting :ref:`Material3D.flags_use_point_size<class_Material3D_property_flags_use_point_size>` and the variable :ref:`Material3D.params_point_size<class_Material3D_property_params_point_size>`.

When using PointMeshes, properties that normally alter vertices will be ignored, including billboard mode, grow, and cull face.
