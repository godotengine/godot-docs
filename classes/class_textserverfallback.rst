Description
-----------

A fallback implementation of Godot's text server. This fallback is faster than :ref:`TextServerAdvanced<class_TextServerAdvanced>` for processing a lot of text, but it does not support BiDi and complex text layout.

\ **Note:** This text server is not part of official Godot binaries. If you want to use it, compile the engine with the option ``module_text_server_fb_enabled=yes``.
