WorldBoundaryShape3D
====================

**Inherits:** :ref:`Shape3D<class_Shape3D>` **<** :ref:`Resource<class_Resource>` **<** :ref:`RefCounted<class_RefCounted>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

A 3D world boundary (half-space) shape used for physics collision.

.. rst-class:: classref-introduction-group

Description
-----------

A 3D world boundary shape, intended for use in physics. **WorldBoundaryShape3D** works like an infinite plane that forces all physics bodies to stay above it. The :ref:`plane<class_WorldBoundaryShape3D_property_plane>`'s normal determines which direction is considered as "above" and in the editor, the line over the plane represents this direction. It can for example be used for endless flat floors.
