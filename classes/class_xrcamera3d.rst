A camera node which automatically positions itself based on XR tracking data.

Description
-----------

A camera node which automatically positions itself based on XR tracking data.

In contrast to :ref:`XRController3D<class_XRController3D>`, the render thread has access to more up-to-date tracking data, and the location of the **XRCamera3D** node can lag a few milliseconds behind what is used for rendering.

\ **Note:** If :ref:`Viewport.use_xr<class_Viewport_property_use_xr>` is ``true``, most of the camera properties are overridden by the active :ref:`XRInterface<class_XRInterface>`. The only properties that can be trusted are the near and far planes.
