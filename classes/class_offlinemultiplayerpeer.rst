OfflineMultiplayerPeer
======================

**Inherits:** :ref:`MultiplayerPeer<class_MultiplayerPeer>` **<** :ref:`PacketPeer<class_PacketPeer>` **<** :ref:`RefCounted<class_RefCounted>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

A :ref:`MultiplayerPeer<class_MultiplayerPeer>` which is always connected and acts as a server.

Description
-----------

This is the default :ref:`MultiplayerAPI.multiplayer_peer<class_MultiplayerAPI_property_multiplayer_peer>` for the :ref:`Node.multiplayer<class_Node_property_multiplayer>`. It mimics the behavior of a server with no peers connected.

This means that the :ref:`SceneTree<class_SceneTree>` will act as the multiplayer authority by default. Calls to :ref:`MultiplayerAPI.is_server()<class_MultiplayerAPI_method_is_server>` will return ``true``, and calls to :ref:`MultiplayerAPI.get_unique_id()<class_MultiplayerAPI_method_get_unique_id>` will return :ref:`MultiplayerPeer.TARGET_PEER_SERVER<class_MultiplayerPeer_constant_TARGET_PEER_SERVER>`.
