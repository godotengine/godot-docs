Description
-----------

LightmapperRD ("RD" stands for :ref:`RenderingDevice<class_RenderingDevice>`) is the built-in GPU-based lightmapper for use with :ref:`LightmapGI<class_LightmapGI>`. On most dedicated GPUs, it can bake lightmaps much faster than most CPU-based lightmappers. LightmapperRD uses compute shaders to bake lightmaps, so it does not require CUDA or OpenCL libraries to be installed to be usable.

\ **Note:** Only usable when using the Vulkan backend (Forward+ or Mobile), not OpenGL.
