Description
-----------

A resource to add to an :ref:`AnimationNodeBlendTree<class_AnimationNodeBlendTree>`. Blends two animations subtractively based on the amount value.

This animation node is usually used for pre-calculation to cancel out any extra poses from the animation for the "add" animation source in :ref:`AnimationNodeAdd2<class_AnimationNodeAdd2>` or :ref:`AnimationNodeAdd3<class_AnimationNodeAdd3>`.

In general, the blend value should be in the ``[0.0, 1.0]`` range, but values outside of this range can be used for amplified or inverted animations.

\ **Note:** This calculation is different from using a negative value in :ref:`AnimationNodeAdd2<class_AnimationNodeAdd2>`, since the transformation matrices do not satisfy the commutative law. **AnimationNodeSub2** multiplies the transformation matrix of the inverted animation from the left side, while negative :ref:`AnimationNodeAdd2<class_AnimationNodeAdd2>` multiplies it from the right side.
