Description
-----------

This node implements all the physics logic needed to simulate a car. It is based on the raycast vehicle system commonly found in physics engines. You will need to add a :ref:`CollisionShape<class_CollisionShape>` for the main body of your vehicle and add :ref:`VehicleWheel<class_VehicleWheel>` nodes for the wheels. You should also add a :ref:`MeshInstance<class_MeshInstance>` to this node for the 3D model of your car but this model should not include meshes for the wheels. You should control the vehicle by using the :ref:`brake<class_VehicleBody_property_brake>`, :ref:`engine_force<class_VehicleBody_property_engine_force>`, and :ref:`steering<class_VehicleBody_property_steering>` properties and not change the position or orientation of this node directly.

**Note:** The origin point of your VehicleBody will determine the center of gravity of your vehicle so it is better to keep this low and move the :ref:`CollisionShape<class_CollisionShape>` and :ref:`MeshInstance<class_MeshInstance>` upwards.

Property Descriptions
---------------------

.. _class_VehicleBody_property_brake:

- :ref:`float<class_float>` **brake**

+-----------+------------------+
| *Default* | 0.0              |
+-----------+------------------+
| *Setter*  | set_brake(value) |
+-----------+------------------+
| *Getter*  | get_brake()      |
+-----------+------------------+

Slows down the vehicle by applying a braking force. The vehicle is only slowed down if the wheels are in contact with a surface. The force you need to apply to adequately slow down your vehicle depends on the :ref:`RigidBody.mass<class_RigidBody_property_mass>` of the vehicle. For a vehicle with a mass set to 1000, try a value in the 25 - 30 range for hard braking.

.. _class_VehicleBody_property_engine_force:

- :ref:`float<class_float>` **engine_force**

+-----------+-------------------------+
| *Default* | 0.0                     |
+-----------+-------------------------+
| *Setter*  | set_engine_force(value) |
+-----------+-------------------------+
| *Getter*  | get_engine_force()      |
+-----------+-------------------------+

Accelerates the vehicle by applying an engine force. The vehicle is only speed up if the wheels that have :ref:`VehicleWheel.use_as_traction<class_VehicleWheel_property_use_as_traction>` set to ``true`` and are in contact with a surface. The :ref:`RigidBody.mass<class_RigidBody_property_mass>` of the vehicle has an effect on the acceleration of the vehicle. For a vehicle with a mass set to 1000, try a value in the 25 - 50 range for acceleration.

**Note:** The simulation does not take the effect of gears into account, you will need to add logic for this if you wish to simulate gears.

A negative value will result in the vehicle reversing.

.. _class_VehicleBody_property_steering:

- :ref:`float<class_float>` **steering**

+-----------+---------------------+
| *Default* | 0.0                 |
+-----------+---------------------+
| *Setter*  | set_steering(value) |
+-----------+---------------------+
| *Getter*  | get_steering()      |
+-----------+---------------------+

The steering angle for the vehicle. Setting this to a non-zero value will result in the vehicle turning when it's moving. Wheels that have :ref:`VehicleWheel.use_as_steering<class_VehicleWheel_property_use_as_steering>` set to ``true`` will automatically be rotated.
