Base class for all event-based stream drivers.

Description
-----------

Base class for all event-based stream drivers. Event streams are music expressed as a series of events (note on, note off, instrument change...), as opposed to audio streams, which are just audio data. Examples of event-based streams are MIDI files, of MOD music.

This class exposes no methods.
