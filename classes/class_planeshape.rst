Infinite plane shape for 3D collisions.

.. rst-class:: classref-introduction-group

Description
-----------

An infinite plane shape for 3D collisions. Note that the :ref:`Plane<class_Plane>`'s normal matters; anything "below" the plane will collide with it. If the **PlaneShape** is used in a :ref:`PhysicsBody<class_PhysicsBody>`, it will cause colliding objects placed "below" it to teleport "above" the plane.
