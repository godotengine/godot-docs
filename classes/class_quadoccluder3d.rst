QuadOccluder3D
==============

**Inherits:** :ref:`Occluder3D<class_Occluder3D>` **<** :ref:`Resource<class_Resource>` **<** :ref:`RefCounted<class_RefCounted>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

Flat plane shape for use with occlusion culling in :ref:`OccluderInstance3D<class_OccluderInstance3D>`.

Description
-----------

``QuadOccluder3D`` stores a flat plane shape that can be used by the engine's occlusion culling system. See also :ref:`PolygonOccluder3D<class_PolygonOccluder3D>` if you need to customize the quad's shape.

See :ref:`OccluderInstance3D<class_OccluderInstance3D>`'s documentation for instructions on setting up occlusion culling.
