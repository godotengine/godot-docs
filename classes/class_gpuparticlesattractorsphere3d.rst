A spheroid-shaped attractor that influences particles from :ref:`GPUParticles3D<class_GPUParticles3D>` nodes.

Description
-----------

A spheroid-shaped attractor that influences particles from :ref:`GPUParticles3D<class_GPUParticles3D>` nodes. Can be used to attract particles towards its origin, or to push them away from its origin.

Particle attractors work in real-time and can be moved, rotated and scaled during gameplay. Unlike collision shapes, non-uniform scaling of attractors is also supported.

\ **Note:** Particle attractors only affect :ref:`GPUParticles3D<class_GPUParticles3D>`, not :ref:`CPUParticles3D<class_CPUParticles3D>`.

- |void| **set_radius**\ (\ value\: :ref:`float<class_float>`\ )
- :ref:`float<class_float>` **get_radius**\ (\ )

The attractor sphere's radius in 3D units.

\ **Note:** Stretched ellipses can be obtained by using non-uniform scaling on the **GPUParticlesAttractorSphere3D** node.
