======

**Inherits:** :ref:`Node2D<class_Node2D>` **<** :ref:`CanvasItem<class_CanvasItem>` **<** :ref:`Node<class_Node>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

Contains a :ref:`Curve2D<class_Curve2D>` path for :ref:`PathFollow2D<class_PathFollow2D>` nodes to follow.

.. rst-class:: classref-introduction-group

Description
-----------

Can have :ref:`PathFollow2D<class_PathFollow2D>` child nodes moving along the :ref:`Curve2D<class_Curve2D>`. See :ref:`PathFollow2D<class_PathFollow2D>` for more information on usage.

\ **Note:** The path is considered as relative to the moved nodes (children of :ref:`PathFollow2D<class_PathFollow2D>`). As such, the curve should usually start with a zero vector (``(0, 0)``).
