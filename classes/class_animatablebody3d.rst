A 3D physics body that can't be moved by external forces. When moved manually, it affects other bodies in its path.

Description
-----------

An animatable 3D physics body. It can't be moved by external forces or contacts, but can be moved manually by other means such as code, :ref:`AnimationMixer<class_AnimationMixer>`\ s (with :ref:`AnimationMixer.callback_mode_process<class_AnimationMixer_property_callback_mode_process>` set to :ref:`AnimationMixer.ANIMATION_CALLBACK_MODE_PROCESS_PHYSICS<class_AnimationMixer_constant_ANIMATION_CALLBACK_MODE_PROCESS_PHYSICS>`), and :ref:`RemoteTransform3D<class_RemoteTransform3D>`.

When **AnimatableBody3D** is moved, its linear and angular velocity are estimated and used to affect other physics bodies in its path. This makes it useful for moving platforms, doors, and other moving objects.

.. _class_AnimatableBody3D_property_sync_to_physics:

.. rst-class:: classref-property

:ref:`bool<class_bool>` **sync_to_physics** = ``true`` :ref:`🔗<class_AnimatableBody3D_property_sync_to_physics>`

.. rst-class:: classref-property-setget

- |void| **set_sync_to_physics**\ (\ value\: :ref:`bool<class_bool>`\ )
- :ref:`bool<class_bool>` **is_sync_to_physics_enabled**\ (\ )

If ``true``, the body's movement will be synchronized to the physics frame. This is useful when animating movement via :ref:`AnimationPlayer<class_AnimationPlayer>`, for example on moving platforms. Do **not** use together with :ref:`PhysicsBody3D.move_and_collide()<class_PhysicsBody3D_method_move_and_collide>`.
