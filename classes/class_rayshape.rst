Description
-----------

Ray shape for 3D collisions, which can be set into a :ref:`PhysicsBody<class_PhysicsBody>` or :ref:`Area<class_Area>`. A ray is not really a collision body, instead it tries to separate itself from whatever is touching its far endpoint. It's often useful for characters.

Property Descriptions

  .. _class_RayShape_length:

- :ref:`float<class_float>` **length** - The ray's length.

  .. _class_RayShape_slips_on_slope:

- :ref:`bool<class_bool>` **slips_on_slope** - If ``true`` allow the shape to return the correct normal. Default value: ``false``.
