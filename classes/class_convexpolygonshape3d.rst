Convex polygon shape resource for 3D physics.

Description
-----------

3D convex polygon shape resource to be added as a *direct* child of a :ref:`PhysicsBody3D<class_PhysicsBody3D>` or :ref:`Area3D<class_Area3D>` using a :ref:`CollisionShape3D<class_CollisionShape3D>` node.

The shape is a *solid* that includes all the points that it encloses, as opposed to :ref:`ConcavePolygonShape3D<class_ConcavePolygonShape3D>` which is hollow if it encloses anything. See also :ref:`CollisionPolygon3D<class_CollisionPolygon3D>`.

The solid nature of the shape makes it well-suited for both detection and physics; in physics body interactions this allows depenetrating even those shapes which end up (e.g. due to high speed) fully inside the convex shape (similarly to primitive shapes, but unlike :ref:`ConcavePolygonShape3D<class_ConcavePolygonShape3D>` and :ref:`HeightMapShape3D<class_HeightMapShape3D>`). The convexity restricts the possible geometric shape of a single **ConvexPolygonShape3D**: it cannot be concave.

\ **Convex decomposition:** Concave objects' collisions can be represented accurately using *several* convex shapes. This allows dynamic physics bodies to have complex concave collisions (at a performance cost). It can be achieved by using several **ConvexPolygonShape3D** nodes or by using the :ref:`CollisionPolygon3D<class_CollisionPolygon3D>` node. To generate a collision polygon from a mesh, select the :ref:`MeshInstance3D<class_MeshInstance3D>` node, go to the **Mesh** menu that appears above the viewport and choose **Create Multiple Convex Collision Siblings**. Alternatively, :ref:`MeshInstance3D.create_multiple_convex_collisions<class_MeshInstance3D_method_create_multiple_convex_collisions>` can be called in a script to perform this decomposition at run-time.

\ **Performance:** **ConvexPolygonShape3D** is faster to check collisions against compared to :ref:`ConcavePolygonShape3D<class_ConcavePolygonShape3D>`, but it is slower than primitive collision shapes such as :ref:`SphereShape3D<class_SphereShape3D>` or :ref:`BoxShape3D<class_BoxShape3D>`. Its use should generally be limited to medium-sized objects that cannot have their collision accurately represented by primitive shapes.
