A 3D convex polyhedron shape used for physics collision.

Description
-----------

A 3D convex polyhedron shape, intended for use in physics. Usually used to provide a shape for a :ref:`CollisionShape3D<class_CollisionShape3D>`.

\ **ConvexPolygonShape3D** is *solid*, which means it detects collisions from objects that are fully inside it, unlike :ref:`ConcavePolygonShape3D<class_ConcavePolygonShape3D>` which is hollow. This makes it more suitable for both detection and physics.

\ **Convex decomposition:** A concave polyhedron can be split up into several convex polyhedra. This allows dynamic physics bodies to have complex concave collisions (at a performance cost) and can be achieved by using several **ConvexPolygonShape3D** nodes. To generate a convex decomposition from a mesh, select the :ref:`MeshInstance3D<class_MeshInstance3D>` node, go to the **Mesh** menu that appears above the viewport, and choose **Create Multiple Convex Collision Siblings**. Alternatively, :ref:`MeshInstance3D.create_multiple_convex_collisions()<class_MeshInstance3D_method_create_multiple_convex_collisions>` can be called in a script to perform this decomposition at run-time.

\ **Performance:** **ConvexPolygonShape3D** is faster to check collisions against compared to :ref:`ConcavePolygonShape3D<class_ConcavePolygonShape3D>`, but it is slower than primitive collision shapes such as :ref:`SphereShape3D<class_SphereShape3D>` and :ref:`BoxShape3D<class_BoxShape3D>`. Its use should generally be limited to medium-sized objects that cannot have their collision accurately represented by primitive shapes.
