ShaderInclude
=============

**Inherits:** :ref:`Resource<class_Resource>` **<** :ref:`RefCounted<class_RefCounted>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

A snippet of shader code to be included in a :ref:`Shader<class_Shader>` with ``#include``.

.. rst-class:: classref-introduction-group

Description
-----------

A shader include file, saved with the ``.gdshaderinc`` extension. This class allows you to define a custom shader snippet that can be included in a :ref:`Shader<class_Shader>` by using the preprocessor directive ``#include``, followed by the file path (e.g. ``#include "res://shader_lib.gdshaderinc"``). The snippet doesn't have to be a valid shader on its own.

Returns the code of the shader include file. The returned text is what the user has written, not the full generated code used internally.

.. |virtual| replace:: :abbr:`virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`
.. |const| replace:: :abbr:`const (This method has no side effects. It doesn't modify any of the instance's member variables.)`
.. |vararg| replace:: :abbr:`vararg (This method accepts any number of arguments after the ones described here.)`
.. |constructor| replace:: :abbr:`constructor (This method is used to construct a type.)`
.. |static| replace:: :abbr:`static (This method doesn't need an instance to be called, so it can be called directly using the class name.)`
