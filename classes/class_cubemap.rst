Six square textures representing the faces of a cube. Commonly used as a skybox.

Description
-----------

A cubemap is made of 6 textures organized in layers. They are typically used for faking reflections in 3D rendering (see :ref:`ReflectionProbe<class_ReflectionProbe>`). It can be used to make an object look as if it's reflecting its surroundings. This usually delivers much better performance than other reflection methods.

This resource is typically used as a uniform in custom shaders. Few core Godot methods make use of **Cubemap** resources.

To create such a texture file yourself, reimport your image files using the Godot Editor import presets. The expected image order is X+, X-, Y+, Y-, Z+, Z- (in Godot's coordinate system, so Y+ is "up" and Z- is "forward"). You can use one of the following templates as a base:

- `2Ã—3 cubemap template (default layout option) <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godotengine/godot-docs/master/img/cubemap_template_2x3.webp>`__\ 

- `3Ã—2 cubemap template <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godotengine/godot-docs/master/img/cubemap_template_3x2.webp>`__\ 

- `1Ã—6 cubemap template <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godotengine/godot-docs/master/img/cubemap_template_1x6.webp>`__\ 

- `6Ã—1 cubemap template <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godotengine/godot-docs/master/img/cubemap_template_6x1.webp>`__\ 

\ **Note:** Godot doesn't support using cubemaps in a :ref:`PanoramaSkyMaterial<class_PanoramaSkyMaterial>`. To use a cubemap as a skybox, convert the default :ref:`PanoramaSkyMaterial<class_PanoramaSkyMaterial>` to a :ref:`ShaderMaterial<class_ShaderMaterial>` using the **Convert to ShaderMaterial** resource dropdown option, then replace its code with the following:

.. code:: text

    shader_type sky;
    
    uniform samplerCube source_panorama : filter_linear, source_color, hint_default_black;
    uniform float exposure : hint_range(0, 128) = 1.0;
    
    void sky() {
        // If importing a cubemap from another engine, you may need to flip one of the `EYEDIR` components below
        // by replacing it with `-EYEDIR`.
        vec3 eyedir = vec3(EYEDIR.x, EYEDIR.y, EYEDIR.z);
        COLOR = texture(source_panorama, eyedir).rgb * exposure;
    }

After replacing the shader code and saving, specify the imported Cubemap resource in the Shader Parameters section of the ShaderMaterial in the inspector.

Alternatively, you can use `this tool <https://danilw.github.io/GLSL-howto/cubemap_to_panorama_js/cubemap_to_panorama.html>`__ to convert a cubemap to an equirectangular sky map and use :ref:`PanoramaSkyMaterial<class_PanoramaSkyMaterial>` as usual.
