**Inherits:** :ref:`VisualScriptNode<class_VisualScriptNode>` **<** :ref:`Resource<class_Resource>` **<** :ref:`RefCounted<class_RefCounted>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

A Visual Script node which branches the flow.

Description
-----------

A Visual Script node that checks a :ref:`bool<class_bool>` input port. If ``true``, it will exit via the "true" sequence port. If ``false``, it will exit via the "false" sequence port. After exiting either, it exits via the "done" port. Sequence ports may be left disconnected.

\ **Input Ports:**\ 

- Sequence: ``if (cond) is``\ 

- Data (boolean): ``cond``\ 

\ **Output Ports:**\ 

- Sequence: ``true``\ 

- Sequence: ``false``\ 

- Sequence: ``done``
