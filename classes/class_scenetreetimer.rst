SceneTreeTimer
==============

**Inherits:** :ref:`RefCounted<class_RefCounted>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

One-shot timer.

.. rst-class:: classref-introduction-group

Description
-----------

A one-shot timer managed by the scene tree, which emits :ref:`timeout<class_SceneTreeTimer_signal_timeout>` on completion. See also :ref:`SceneTree.create_timer<class_SceneTree_method_create_timer>`.

As opposed to :ref:`Timer<class_Timer>`, it does not require the instantiation of a node. Commonly used to create a one-shot delay timer as in the following example:


.. tabs::

 .. code-tab:: gdscript

    func some_function():
        print("Timer started.")
        await get_tree().create_timer(1.0).timeout
        print("Timer ended.")

 .. code-tab:: csharp

    public async Task SomeFunction()
    {
        GD.Print("Timer started.");
        await ToSignal(GetTree().CreateTimer(1.0f), SceneTreeTimer.SignalName.Timeout);
        GD.Print("Timer ended.");
    }



The timer will be dereferenced after its time elapses. To preserve the timer, you can keep a reference to it. See :ref:`RefCounted<class_RefCounted>`.

\ **Note:** The timer is processed after all of the nodes in the current frame, i.e. node's :ref:`Node._process<class_Node_private_method__process>` method would be called before the timer (or :ref:`Node._physics_process<class_Node_private_method__physics_process>` if ``process_in_physics`` in :ref:`SceneTree.create_timer<class_SceneTree_method_create_timer>` has been set to ``true``).
