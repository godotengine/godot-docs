VehicleBody3D
=============

**Inherits:** :ref:`RigidBody3D<class_RigidBody3D>` **<** :ref:`PhysicsBody3D<class_PhysicsBody3D>` **<** :ref:`CollisionObject3D<class_CollisionObject3D>` **<** :ref:`Node3D<class_Node3D>` **<** :ref:`Node<class_Node>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

A 3D physics body that simulates the behavior of a car.

.. rst-class:: classref-introduction-group

Description
-----------

This physics body implements all the physics logic needed to simulate a car. It is based on the raycast vehicle system commonly found in physics engines. Aside from a :ref:`CollisionShape3D<class_CollisionShape3D>` for the main body of the vehicle, you must also add a :ref:`VehicleWheel3D<class_VehicleWheel3D>` node for each wheel. You should also add a :ref:`MeshInstance3D<class_MeshInstance3D>` to this node for the 3D model of the vehicle, but this model should generally not include meshes for the wheels. You can control the vehicle by using the :ref:`brake<class_VehicleBody3D_property_brake>`, :ref:`engine_force<class_VehicleBody3D_property_engine_force>`, and :ref:`steering<class_VehicleBody3D_property_steering>` properties. The position or orientation of this node shouldn't be changed directly.

\ **Note:** The origin point of your VehicleBody3D will determine the center of gravity of your vehicle. To make the vehicle more grounded, the origin point is usually kept low, moving the :ref:`CollisionShape3D<class_CollisionShape3D>` and :ref:`MeshInstance3D<class_MeshInstance3D>` upwards.

\ **Note:** This class has known issues and isn't designed to provide realistic 3D vehicle physics. If you want advanced vehicle physics, you may have to write your own physics integration using :ref:`CharacterBody3D<class_CharacterBody3D>` or :ref:`RigidBody3D<class_RigidBody3D>`.

Property Descriptions
---------------------

.. _class_VehicleBody3D_property_brake:

.. rst-class:: classref-property

:ref:`float<class_float>` **brake** = ``0.0``

.. rst-class:: classref-property-setget

- |void| **set_brake**\ (\ value\: :ref:`float<class_float>`\ )
- :ref:`float<class_float>` **get_brake**\ (\ )

Slows down the vehicle by applying a braking force. The vehicle is only slowed down if the wheels are in contact with a surface. The force you need to apply to adequately slow down your vehicle depends on the :ref:`RigidBody3D.mass<class_RigidBody3D_property_mass>` of the vehicle. For a vehicle with a mass set to 1000, try a value in the 25 - 30 range for hard braking.

.. _class_VehicleBody3D_property_engine_force:

.. rst-class:: classref-property

:ref:`float<class_float>` **engine_force** = ``0.0``

.. rst-class:: classref-property-setget

- |void| **set_engine_force**\ (\ value\: :ref:`float<class_float>`\ )
- :ref:`float<class_float>` **get_engine_force**\ (\ )

Accelerates the vehicle by applying an engine force. The vehicle is only sped up if the wheels that have :ref:`VehicleWheel3D.use_as_traction<class_VehicleWheel3D_property_use_as_traction>` set to ``true`` and are in contact with a surface. The :ref:`RigidBody3D.mass<class_RigidBody3D_property_mass>` of the vehicle has an effect on the acceleration of the vehicle. For a vehicle with a mass set to 1000, try a value in the 25 - 50 range for acceleration.

\ **Note:** The simulation does not take the effect of gears into account, you will need to add logic for this if you wish to simulate gears.

A negative value will result in the vehicle reversing.

.. _class_VehicleBody3D_property_steering:

.. rst-class:: classref-property

:ref:`float<class_float>` **steering** = ``0.0``

.. rst-class:: classref-property-setget

- |void| **set_steering**\ (\ value\: :ref:`float<class_float>`\ )
- :ref:`float<class_float>` **get_steering**\ (\ )

The steering angle for the vehicle. Setting this to a non-zero value will result in the vehicle turning when it's moving. Wheels that have :ref:`VehicleWheel3D.use_as_steering<class_VehicleWheel3D_property_use_as_steering>` set to ``true`` will automatically be rotated.

\ **Note:** This property is edited in the inspector in degrees. In code the property is set in radians.

.. |virtual| replace:: :abbr:`virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`
.. |const| replace:: :abbr:`const (This method has no side effects. It doesn't modify any of the instance's member variables.)`
.. |vararg| replace:: :abbr:`vararg (This method accepts any number of arguments after the ones described here.)`
.. |constructor| replace:: :abbr:`constructor (This method is used to construct a type.)`
.. |static| replace:: :abbr:`static (This method doesn't need an instance to be called, so it can be called directly using the class name.)`
.. |operator| replace:: :abbr:`operator (This method describes a valid operator to use with this type as left-hand operand.)`
.. |bitfield| replace:: :abbr:`BitField (This value is an integer composed as a bitmask of the following flags.)`
