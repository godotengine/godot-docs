Description
-----------

Imports Autodesk FBX 3D scenes by way of converting them to glTF 2.0 using the FBX2glTF command line tool.

The location of the FBX2glTF binary is set via the :ref:`EditorSettings.filesystem/import/fbx/fbx2gltf_path<class_EditorSettings_property_filesystem/import/fbx/fbx2gltf_path>` editor setting.

This importer is only used if :ref:`ProjectSettings.filesystem/import/fbx2gltf/enabled<class_ProjectSettings_property_filesystem/import/fbx2gltf/enabled>` is set to ``true``.
