**Inherits:** :ref:`XRPositionalTracker<class_XRPositionalTracker>` **<** :ref:`XRTracker<class_XRTracker>` **<** :ref:`RefCounted<class_RefCounted>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

A tracked controller.

.. rst-class:: classref-introduction-group

Description
-----------

An instance of this object represents a controller that is tracked.

As controllers are turned on and the :ref:`XRInterface<class_XRInterface>` detects them, instances of this object are automatically added to this list of active tracking objects accessible through the :ref:`XRServer<class_XRServer>`.

The :ref:`XRController3D<class_XRController3D>` consumes objects of this type and should be used in your project.
