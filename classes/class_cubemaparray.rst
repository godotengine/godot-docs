CubemapArray
============

**Inherits:** :ref:`ImageTextureLayered<class_ImageTextureLayered>` **<** :ref:`TextureLayered<class_TextureLayered>` **<** :ref:`Texture<class_Texture>` **<** :ref:`Resource<class_Resource>` **<** :ref:`RefCounted<class_RefCounted>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

An array of :ref:`Cubemap<class_Cubemap>`\ s, stored together and with a single reference.

.. rst-class:: classref-introduction-group

Description
-----------

**CubemapArray**\ s are made of an array of :ref:`Cubemap<class_Cubemap>`\ s. Like :ref:`Cubemap<class_Cubemap>`\ s, they are made of multiple textures, the amount of which must be divisible by 6 (one for each face of the cube).

The primary benefit of **CubemapArray**\ s is that they can be accessed in shader code using a single texture reference. In other words, you can pass multiple :ref:`Cubemap<class_Cubemap>`\ s into a shader using a single **CubemapArray**. :ref:`Cubemap<class_Cubemap>`\ s are allocated in adjacent cache regions on the GPU, which makes **CubemapArray**\ s the most efficient way to store multiple :ref:`Cubemap<class_Cubemap>`\ s.

\ **Note:** Godot uses **CubemapArray**\ s internally for many effects, including the :ref:`Sky<class_Sky>` if you set :ref:`ProjectSettings.rendering/reflections/sky_reflections/texture_array_reflections<class_ProjectSettings_property_rendering/reflections/sky_reflections/texture_array_reflections>` to ``true``. To create such a texture file yourself, reimport your image files using the import presets of the File System dock.

\ **Note:** **CubemapArray** is not supported in the Compatibility renderer.
