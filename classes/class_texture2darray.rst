Texture2DArray
==============

**Inherits:** :ref:`ImageTextureLayered<class_ImageTextureLayered>` **<** :ref:`TextureLayered<class_TextureLayered>` **<** :ref:`Texture<class_Texture>` **<** :ref:`Resource<class_Resource>` **<** :ref:`RefCounted<class_RefCounted>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

A single texture resource which consists of multiple, separate images. Each image has the same dimensions and number of mipmap levels.

Description
-----------

A Texture2DArray is different from a Texture3D: The Texture2DArray does not support trilinear interpolation between the :ref:`Image<class_Image>`\ s, i.e. no blending. See also :ref:`Cubemap<class_Cubemap>` and :ref:`CubemapArray<class_CubemapArray>`, which are texture arrays with specialized cubemap functions.

A Texture2DArray is also different from an :ref:`AtlasTexture<class_AtlasTexture>`: In a Texture2DArray, all images are treated separately. In an atlas, the regions (i.e. the single images) can be of different sizes. Furthermore, you usually need to add a padding around the regions, to prevent accidental UV mapping to more than one region. The same goes for mipmapping: Mipmap chains are handled separately for each layer. In an atlas, the slicing has to be done manually in the fragment shader.

To create such a texture file yourself, reimport your image files using the Godot Editor import presets. To create a Texture2DArray from code, use :ref:`ImageTextureLayered.create_from_images()<class_ImageTextureLayered_method_create_from_images>` on an instance of the Texture2DArray class.

:ref:`Resource<class_Resource>` **create_placeholder**\ (\ ) |const| :ref:`🔗<class_Texture2DArray_method_create_placeholder>`

Creates a placeholder version of this resource (:ref:`PlaceholderTexture2DArray<class_PlaceholderTexture2DArray>`).
