A dummy text server that can't render text or manage fonts.

Description
-----------

A dummy :ref:`TextServer<class_TextServer>` interface that doesn't do anything. Useful for freeing up memory when rendering text is not needed, as text servers are resource-intensive. It can also be used for performance comparisons in complex GUIs to check the impact of text rendering.

A dummy text server is always available at the start of a project. Here's how to access it:

::

    var dummy_text_server = TextServerManager.find_interface("Dummy")
    if dummy_text_server != null:
        TextServerManager.set_primary_interface(dummy_text_server)
        # If the other text servers are unneeded, they can be removed:
        for i in TextServerManager.get_interface_count():
            var text_server = TextServerManager.get_interface(i)
            if text_server != dummy_text_server:
                TextServerManager.remove_interface(text_server)

The command line argument ``--text-driver Dummy`` (case-sensitive) can be used to force the "Dummy" :ref:`TextServer<class_TextServer>` on any project.
