A :ref:`Cubemap<class_Cubemap>` without image data.

Description
-----------

This class replaces a :ref:`Cubemap<class_Cubemap>` or a :ref:`Cubemap<class_Cubemap>`-derived class in 2 conditions:

- In dedicated server mode, where the image data shouldn't affect game logic. This allows reducing the exported PCK's size significantly.

- When the :ref:`Cubemap<class_Cubemap>`-derived class is missing, for example when using a different engine version.

\ **Note:** This class is not intended for rendering or for use in shaders. Operations like calculating UV are not guaranteed to work.

.. |virtual| replace:: :abbr:`virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`
.. |const| replace:: :abbr:`const (This method has no side effects. It doesn't modify any of the instance's member variables.)`
.. |vararg| replace:: :abbr:`vararg (This method accepts any number of arguments after the ones described here.)`
.. |constructor| replace:: :abbr:`constructor (This method is used to construct a type.)`
.. |static| replace:: :abbr:`static (This method doesn't need an instance to be called, so it can be called directly using the class name.)`
.. |operator| replace:: :abbr:`operator (This method describes a valid operator to use with this type as left-hand operand.)`
.. |bitfield| replace:: :abbr:`BitField (This value is an integer composed as a bitmask of the following flags.)`
.. |void| replace:: :abbr:`void (No return value.)`
