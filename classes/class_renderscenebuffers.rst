==================

**Inherits:** :ref:`RefCounted<class_RefCounted>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

**Inherited By:** :ref:`RenderSceneBuffersExtension<class_RenderSceneBuffersExtension>`, :ref:`RenderSceneBuffersRD<class_RenderSceneBuffersRD>`

Abstract scene buffers object, created for each viewport for which 3D rendering is done.

.. rst-class:: classref-introduction-group

Description
-----------

Abstract scene buffers object, created for each viewport for which 3D rendering is done. It manages any additional buffers used during rendering and will discard buffers when the viewport is resized.

\ **Note:** This is an internal rendering server object, do not instantiate this from script.

.. _class_RenderSceneBuffers_method_configure:

.. rst-class:: classref-method

|void| **configure**\ (\ config\: :ref:`RenderSceneBuffersConfiguration<class_RenderSceneBuffersConfiguration>`\ )

This method is called by the rendering server when the associated viewports configuration is changed. It will discard the old buffers and recreate the internal buffers used.

.. |virtual| replace:: :abbr:`virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`
.. |const| replace:: :abbr:`const (This method has no side effects. It doesn't modify any of the instance's member variables.)`
.. |vararg| replace:: :abbr:`vararg (This method accepts any number of arguments after the ones described here.)`
.. |constructor| replace:: :abbr:`constructor (This method is used to construct a type.)`
.. |static| replace:: :abbr:`static (This method doesn't need an instance to be called, so it can be called directly using the class name.)`
.. |operator| replace:: :abbr:`operator (This method describes a valid operator to use with this type as left-hand operand.)`
.. |bitfield| replace:: :abbr:`BitField (This value is an integer composed as a bitmask of the following flags.)`
.. |void| replace:: :abbr:`void (No return value.)`
