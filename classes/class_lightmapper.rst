Lightmapper
===========

**Inherits:** :ref:`RefCounted<class_RefCounted>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

**Inherited By:** :ref:`LightmapperRD<class_LightmapperRD>`

Abstract class extended by lightmappers, for use in :ref:`LightmapGI<class_LightmapGI>`.

.. rst-class:: classref-introduction-group

Description
-----------

This class should be extended by custom lightmapper classes. Lightmappers can then be used with :ref:`LightmapGI<class_LightmapGI>` to provide fast baked global illumination in 3D.

Godot contains a built-in GPU-based lightmapper :ref:`LightmapperRD<class_LightmapperRD>` that uses compute shaders, but custom lightmappers can be implemented by C++ modules.
