AnimationNodeTimeSeek
=====================

**Inherits:** :ref:`AnimationNode<class_AnimationNode>` **<** :ref:`Resource<class_Resource>` **<** :ref:`RefCounted<class_RefCounted>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

A time-seeking animation node used in :ref:`AnimationTree<class_AnimationTree>`.

.. rst-class:: classref-introduction-group

Description
-----------

This animation node can be used to cause a seek command to happen to any sub-children of the animation graph. Use to play an :ref:`Animation<class_Animation>` from the start or a certain playback position inside the :ref:`AnimationNodeBlendTree<class_AnimationNodeBlendTree>`.

After setting the time and changing the animation playback, the time seek node automatically goes into sleep mode on the next process frame by setting its ``seek_request`` value to ``-1.0``.

    # Play child animation from 12 second timestamp.
    animation_tree.set("parameters/TimeSeek/seek_request", 12.0)
    # Alternative syntax (same result as above).
    animation_tree["parameters/TimeSeek/seek_request"] = 12.0
