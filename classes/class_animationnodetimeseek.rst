AnimationNodeTimeSeek
=====================

**Inherits:** :ref:`AnimationNode<class_AnimationNode>` **<** :ref:`Resource<class_Resource>` **<** :ref:`Reference<class_Reference>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

A time-seeking animation node to be used with :ref:`AnimationTree<class_AnimationTree>`.

.. rst-class:: classref-introduction-group

Description
-----------

This node can be used to cause a seek command to happen to any sub-children of the animation graph. Use this node type to play an :ref:`Animation<class_Animation>` from the start or a certain playback position inside the :ref:`AnimationNodeBlendTree<class_AnimationNodeBlendTree>`. After setting the time and changing the animation playback, the seek node automatically goes into sleep mode on the next process frame by setting its ``seek_position`` value to ``-1.0``.

::

    # Play child animation from the start.
    animation_tree.set("parameters/Seek/seek_position", 0.0)
    # Alternative syntax (same result as above).
    animation_tree["parameters/Seek/seek_position"] = 0.0
    
    # Play child animation from 12 second timestamp.
    animation_tree.set("parameters/Seek/seek_position", 12.0)
    # Alternative syntax (same result as above).
    animation_tree["parameters/Seek/seek_position"] = 12.0
