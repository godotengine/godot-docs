Description
-----------

This class provides access to a number of different monitors related to performance, such as memory usage, draw calls, and FPS. These are the same as the values displayed in the **Monitor** tab in the editor's **Debugger** panel. By using the :ref:`get_monitor<class_Performance_method_get_monitor>` method of this class, you can access this data from your code.

**Note:** A few of these monitors are only available in debug mode and will always return 0 when used in a release build.

**Note:** Many of these monitors are not updated in real-time, so there may be a short delay between changes.

Method Descriptions
-------------------

.. _class_Performance_method_get_monitor:

- :ref:`float<class_float>` **get_monitor** **(** :ref:`Monitor<enum_Performance_Monitor>` monitor **)** const

Returns the value of one of the available monitors. You should provide one of the :ref:`Monitor<enum_Performance_Monitor>` constants as the argument, like this:

::

    print(Performance.get_monitor(Performance.TIME_FPS)) # Prints the FPS to the console
