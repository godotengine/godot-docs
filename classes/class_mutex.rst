Mutex
=====

**Inherits:** :ref:`RefCounted<class_RefCounted>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

A binary :ref:`Semaphore<class_Semaphore>` for synchronization of multiple :ref:`Thread<class_Thread>`\ s.

.. rst-class:: classref-introduction-group

Description
-----------

A synchronization mutex (mutual exclusion). This is used to synchronize multiple :ref:`Thread<class_Thread>`\ s, and is equivalent to a binary :ref:`Semaphore<class_Semaphore>`. It guarantees that only one thread can access a critical section at a time.

This is a reentrant mutex, meaning that it can be locked multiple times by one thread, provided it also unlocks it as many times.

\ **Warning:** Mutexes must be used carefully to avoid deadlocks.

\ **Warning:** To ensure proper cleanup without crashes or deadlocks, the following conditions must be met:

- When a **Mutex**'s reference count reaches zero and it is therefore destroyed, no threads (including the one on which the destruction will happen) must have it locked.

- When a :ref:`Thread<class_Thread>`'s reference count reaches zero and it is therefore destroyed, it must not have any mutex locked.

Method Descriptions
-------------------

.. _class_Mutex_method_lock:

.. rst-class:: classref-method

|void| **lock**\ (\ ) :ref:`🔗<class_Mutex_method_lock>`

Locks this **Mutex**, blocks until it is unlocked by the current owner.

\ **Note:** This function returns without blocking if the thread already has ownership of the mutex.

.. rst-class:: classref-item-separator

----

.. _class_Mutex_method_try_lock:

.. rst-class:: classref-method

:ref:`bool<class_bool>` **try_lock**\ (\ ) :ref:`🔗<class_Mutex_method_try_lock>`

Tries locking this **Mutex**, but does not block. Returns ``true`` on success, ``false`` otherwise.

\ **Note:** This function returns ``true`` if the thread already has ownership of the mutex.

.. rst-class:: classref-item-separator

----

.. _class_Mutex_method_unlock:

.. rst-class:: classref-method

|void| **unlock**\ (\ ) :ref:`🔗<class_Mutex_method_unlock>`

Unlocks this **Mutex**, leaving it to other threads.

\ **Note:** If a thread called :ref:`lock()<class_Mutex_method_lock>` or :ref:`try_lock()<class_Mutex_method_try_lock>` multiple times while already having ownership of the mutex, it must also call :ref:`unlock()<class_Mutex_method_unlock>` the same number of times in order to unlock it correctly.

\ **Warning:** Calling :ref:`unlock()<class_Mutex_method_unlock>` more times that :ref:`lock()<class_Mutex_method_lock>` on a given thread, thus ending up trying to unlock a non-locked mutex, is wrong and may causes crashes or deadlocks.
