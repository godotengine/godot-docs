Imports an image for use in scripting, with no rendering capabilities.

Description
-----------

This importer imports :ref:`Image<class_Image>` resources, as opposed to :ref:`CompressedTexture2D<class_CompressedTexture2D>`. If you need to render the image in 2D or 3D, use :ref:`ResourceImporterTexture<class_ResourceImporterTexture>` instead.
