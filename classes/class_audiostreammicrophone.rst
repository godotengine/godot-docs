Plays real-time audio input data.

Description
-----------

When used directly in an :ref:`AudioStreamPlayer<class_AudioStreamPlayer>` node, **AudioStreamMicrophone** plays back microphone input in real-time. This can be used in conjunction with :ref:`AudioEffectCapture<class_AudioEffectCapture>` to process the data or save it.

\ **Note:** :ref:`ProjectSettings.audio/driver/enable_input<class_ProjectSettings_property_audio/driver/enable_input>` must be ``true`` for audio input to work. See also that setting's description for caveats related to permissions and operating system privacy settings.
