A box-shaped 3D particle collision shape affecting :ref:`GPUParticles3D<class_GPUParticles3D>` nodes.

Description
-----------

A box-shaped 3D particle collision shape affecting :ref:`GPUParticles3D<class_GPUParticles3D>` nodes.

Particle collision shapes work in real-time and can be moved, rotated and scaled during gameplay. Unlike attractors, non-uniform scaling of collision shapes is *not* supported.

\ **Note:** :ref:`ParticleProcessMaterial.collision_mode<class_ParticleProcessMaterial_property_collision_mode>` must be :ref:`ParticleProcessMaterial.COLLISION_RIGID<class_ParticleProcessMaterial_constant_COLLISION_RIGID>` or :ref:`ParticleProcessMaterial.COLLISION_HIDE_ON_CONTACT<class_ParticleProcessMaterial_constant_COLLISION_HIDE_ON_CONTACT>` on the :ref:`GPUParticles3D<class_GPUParticles3D>`'s process material for collision to work.

\ **Note:** Particle collision only affects :ref:`GPUParticles3D<class_GPUParticles3D>`, not :ref:`CPUParticles3D<class_CPUParticles3D>`.
