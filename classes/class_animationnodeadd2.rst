Description
-----------

A resource to add to an :ref:`AnimationNodeBlendTree<class_AnimationNodeBlendTree>`. Blends two animations additively based on the amount value.

If the amount is greater than ``1.0``, the animation connected to "in" port is blended with the amplified animation connected to "add" port.

If the amount is less than ``0.0``, the animation connected to "in" port is blended with the inverted animation connected to "add" port.
