A CSG Mesh shape that uses a mesh resource.

.. rst-class:: classref-introduction-group

Description
-----------

This CSG node allows you to use any mesh resource as a CSG shape, provided it is closed, does not self-intersect, does not contain internal faces and has no edges that connect to more than two faces. See also :ref:`CSGPolygon3D<class_CSGPolygon3D>` for drawing 2D extruded polygons to be used as CSG nodes.

\ **Note:** CSG nodes are intended to be used for level prototyping. Creating CSG nodes has a significant CPU cost compared to creating a :ref:`MeshInstance3D<class_MeshInstance3D>` with a :ref:`PrimitiveMesh<class_PrimitiveMesh>`. Moving a CSG node within another CSG node also has a significant CPU cost, so it should be avoided during gameplay.

- |void| **set_mesh**\ (\ value\: :ref:`Mesh<class_Mesh>`\ )
- :ref:`Mesh<class_Mesh>` **get_mesh**\ (\ )

The :ref:`Mesh<class_Mesh>` resource to use as a CSG shape.

\ **Note:** When using an :ref:`ArrayMesh<class_ArrayMesh>`, all vertex attributes except :ref:`Mesh.ARRAY_VERTEX<class_Mesh_constant_ARRAY_VERTEX>`, :ref:`Mesh.ARRAY_NORMAL<class_Mesh_constant_ARRAY_NORMAL>` and :ref:`Mesh.ARRAY_TEX_UV<class_Mesh_constant_ARRAY_TEX_UV>` are left unused. Only :ref:`Mesh.ARRAY_VERTEX<class_Mesh_constant_ARRAY_VERTEX>` and :ref:`Mesh.ARRAY_TEX_UV<class_Mesh_constant_ARRAY_TEX_UV>` will be passed to the GPU.

\ :ref:`Mesh.ARRAY_NORMAL<class_Mesh_constant_ARRAY_NORMAL>` is only used to determine which faces require the use of flat shading. By default, CSGMesh will ignore the mesh's vertex normals, recalculate them for each vertex and use a smooth shader. If a flat shader is required for a face, ensure that all vertex normals of the face are approximately equal.
