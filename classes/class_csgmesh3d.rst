**Inherits:** :ref:`CSGPrimitive3D<class_CSGPrimitive3D>` **<** :ref:`CSGShape3D<class_CSGShape3D>` **<** :ref:`GeometryInstance3D<class_GeometryInstance3D>` **<** :ref:`VisualInstance3D<class_VisualInstance3D>` **<** :ref:`Node3D<class_Node3D>` **<** :ref:`Node<class_Node>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

A CSG Mesh shape that uses a mesh resource.

Description
-----------

This CSG node allows you to use any mesh resource as a CSG shape, provided it is closed, does not self-intersect, does not contain internal faces and has no edges that connect to more than two faces. See also :ref:`CSGPolygon3D<class_CSGPolygon3D>` for drawing 2D extruded polygons to be used as CSG nodes.

\ **Note:** CSG nodes are intended to be used for level prototyping. Creating CSG nodes has a significant CPU cost compared to creating a :ref:`MeshInstance3D<class_MeshInstance3D>` with a :ref:`PrimitiveMesh<class_PrimitiveMesh>`. Moving a CSG node within another CSG node also has a significant CPU cost, so it should be avoided during gameplay.

The :ref:`Mesh<class_Mesh>` resource to use as a CSG shape.

\ **Note:** When using an :ref:`ArrayMesh<class_ArrayMesh>`, avoid meshes with vertex normals unless a flat shader is required. By default, CSGMesh will ignore the mesh's vertex normals and use a smooth shader calculated using the faces' normals. If a flat shader is required, ensure that all faces' vertex normals are parallel.
