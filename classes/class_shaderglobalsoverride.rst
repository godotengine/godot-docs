ShaderGlobalsOverride
=====================

**Inherits:** :ref:`Node<class_Node>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

A node used to override global shader parameters' values in a scene.

.. rst-class:: classref-introduction-group

Description
-----------

Similar to how a :ref:`WorldEnvironment<class_WorldEnvironment>` node can be used to override the environment while a specific scene is loaded, **ShaderGlobalsOverride** can be used to override global shader parameters temporarily. Once the node is removed, the project-wide values for the global shader parameters are restored. See the :ref:`RenderingServer<class_RenderingServer>` ``global_shader_parameter_*`` methods for more information.

\ **Note:** Only one **ShaderGlobalsOverride** can be used per scene. If there is more than one **ShaderGlobalsOverride** node in the scene tree, only the first node (in tree order) will be taken into account.

\ **Note:** All **ShaderGlobalsOverride** nodes are made part of a ``"shader_overrides_group"`` group when they are added to the scene tree. The currently active **ShaderGlobalsOverride** node also has a ``"shader_overrides_group_active"`` group added to it. You can use this to check which **ShaderGlobalsOverride** node is currently active.
