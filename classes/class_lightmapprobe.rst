Represents a single manually placed probe for dynamic object lighting with :ref:`LightmapGI<class_LightmapGI>`.

Description
-----------

**LightmapProbe** represents the position of a single manually placed probe for dynamic object lighting with :ref:`LightmapGI<class_LightmapGI>`. Lightmap probes affect the lighting of :ref:`GeometryInstance3D<class_GeometryInstance3D>`-derived nodes that have their :ref:`GeometryInstance3D.gi_mode<class_GeometryInstance3D_property_gi_mode>` set to :ref:`GeometryInstance3D.GI_MODE_DYNAMIC<class_GeometryInstance3D_constant_GI_MODE_DYNAMIC>`.

Typically, :ref:`LightmapGI<class_LightmapGI>` probes are placed automatically by setting :ref:`LightmapGI.generate_probes_subdiv<class_LightmapGI_property_generate_probes_subdiv>` to a value other than :ref:`LightmapGI.GENERATE_PROBES_DISABLED<class_LightmapGI_constant_GENERATE_PROBES_DISABLED>`. By creating **LightmapProbe** nodes before baking lightmaps, you can add more probes in specific areas for greater detail, or disable automatic generation and rely only on manually placed probes instead.

\ **Note:** **LightmapProbe** nodes that are placed after baking lightmaps are ignored by dynamic objects. You must bake lightmaps again after creating or modifying **LightmapProbe**\ s for the probes to be effective.
