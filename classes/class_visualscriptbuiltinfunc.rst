- **MATH_SQRT** = **10** --- Return the square root of the input.
- **MATH_FMOD** = **11** --- Return the remainder of one input divided by the other, using floating-point numbers.
- **MATH_FPOSMOD** = **12** --- Return the positive remainder of one input divided by the other, using floating-point numbers.
- **MATH_FLOOR** = **13** --- Return the input rounded down.

- **MATH_ISNAN** = **21** --- Return whether the input is NaN (Not a Number) or not. NaN is usually produced by dividing 0 by 0, though other ways exist.
- **MATH_ISINF** = **22** --- Return whether the input is an infinite floating-point number or not. Infinity is usually produced by dividing a number by 0, though other ways exist.
- **MATH_EASE** = **23** --- Easing function, based on exponent. 0 is constant, 1 is linear, 0 to 1 is ease-in, 1+ is ease out. Negative values are in-out/out in.

Description
-----------

A built-in function used inside a :ref:`VisualScript<class_visualscript>`. It is usually a math function or an utility function.

See also :ref:`@GDScript<class_@gdscript>`, for the same functions in the GDScript language.
