A 3D physics body that can't be moved by external forces. When moved manually, it doesn't affect other bodies in its path.

Description
-----------

A static 3D physics body. It can't be moved by external forces or contacts, but can be moved manually by other means such as code, :ref:`AnimationMixer<class_AnimationMixer>`\ s (with :ref:`AnimationMixer.callback_mode_process<class_AnimationMixer_property_callback_mode_process>` set to :ref:`AnimationMixer.ANIMATION_CALLBACK_MODE_PROCESS_PHYSICS<class_AnimationMixer_constant_ANIMATION_CALLBACK_MODE_PROCESS_PHYSICS>`), and :ref:`RemoteTransform3D<class_RemoteTransform3D>`.

When **StaticBody3D** is moved, it is teleported to its new position without affecting other physics bodies in its path. If this is not desired, use :ref:`AnimatableBody3D<class_AnimatableBody3D>` instead.

\ **StaticBody3D** is useful for completely static objects like floors and walls, as well as moving surfaces like conveyor belts and circular revolving platforms (by using :ref:`constant_linear_velocity<class_StaticBody3D_property_constant_linear_velocity>` and :ref:`constant_angular_velocity<class_StaticBody3D_property_constant_angular_velocity>`).

Property Descriptions
---------------------

.. _class_StaticBody3D_property_constant_angular_velocity:

.. rst-class:: classref-property

:ref:`Vector3<class_Vector3>` **constant_angular_velocity** = ``Vector3(0, 0, 0)``

.. rst-class:: classref-property-setget

- void **set_constant_angular_velocity** **(** :ref:`Vector3<class_Vector3>` value **)**
- :ref:`Vector3<class_Vector3>` **get_constant_angular_velocity** **(** **)**

The body's constant angular velocity. This does not rotate the body, but affects touching bodies, as if it were rotating.

.. _class_StaticBody3D_property_constant_linear_velocity:

.. rst-class:: classref-property

:ref:`Vector3<class_Vector3>` **constant_linear_velocity** = ``Vector3(0, 0, 0)``

.. rst-class:: classref-property-setget

- void **set_constant_linear_velocity** **(** :ref:`Vector3<class_Vector3>` value **)**
- :ref:`Vector3<class_Vector3>` **get_constant_linear_velocity** **(** **)**

The body's constant linear velocity. This does not move the body, but affects touching bodies, as if it were moving.

.. _class_StaticBody3D_property_physics_material_override:

.. rst-class:: classref-property

:ref:`PhysicsMaterial<class_PhysicsMaterial>` **physics_material_override**

.. rst-class:: classref-property-setget

- void **set_physics_material_override** **(** :ref:`PhysicsMaterial<class_PhysicsMaterial>` value **)**
- :ref:`PhysicsMaterial<class_PhysicsMaterial>` **get_physics_material_override** **(** **)**

The physics material override for the body.

If a material is assigned to this property, it will be used instead of any other physics material, such as an inherited one.
