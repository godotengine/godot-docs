Blends two of three animations linearly inside of an :ref:`AnimationNodeBlendTree<class_AnimationNodeBlendTree>`.

Description
-----------

A resource to add to an :ref:`AnimationNodeBlendTree<class_AnimationNodeBlendTree>`. Blends two animations out of three linearly out of three based on the amount value.

This animation node has three inputs:

- The base animation to blend with

- A "-blend" animation to blend with when the blend amount is negative value

- A "+blend" animation to blend with when the blend amount is positive value

In general, the blend value should be in the ``[-1.0, 1.0]`` range. Values outside of this range can blend amplified animations, however, :ref:`AnimationNodeAdd3<class_AnimationNodeAdd3>` works better for this purpose.
