Blends two of three animations additively inside of an :ref:`AnimationNodeBlendTree<class_AnimationNodeBlendTree>`.

Description
-----------

A resource to add to an :ref:`AnimationNodeBlendTree<class_AnimationNodeBlendTree>`. Blends two animations out of three additively out of three based on the amount value.

This animation node has three inputs:

- The base animation to add to

- A "-add" animation to blend with when the blend amount is negative

- A "+add" animation to blend with when the blend amount is positive

If the absolute value of the amount is greater than ``1.0``, the animation connected to "in" port is blended with the amplified animation connected to "-add"/"+add" port.
