Class for displaying popups with a panel background.

.. rst-class:: classref-introduction-group

Description
-----------

Class for displaying popups with a panel background. In some cases it might be simpler to use than :ref:`Popup<class_Popup>`, since it provides a configurable background. If you are making windows, better check :ref:`WindowDialog<class_WindowDialog>`.

If any :ref:`Control<class_Control>` node is added as a child of this **PopupPanel**, it will be stretched to fit the panel's size (similar to how :ref:`PanelContainer<class_PanelContainer>` works).
