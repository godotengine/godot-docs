=============

**Inherits:** :ref:`BaseMaterial3D<class_BaseMaterial3D>` **<** :ref:`Material<class_Material>` **<** :ref:`Resource<class_Resource>` **<** :ref:`RefCounted<class_RefCounted>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

A PBR (Physically Based Rendering) material to be used on 3D objects. Uses an ORM texture.

Description
-----------

ORMMaterial3D's properties are inherited from :ref:`BaseMaterial3D<class_BaseMaterial3D>`. Unlike :ref:`StandardMaterial3D<class_StandardMaterial3D>`, ORMMaterial3D uses a single texture for ambient occlusion, roughness and metallic maps, known as an ORM texture.
