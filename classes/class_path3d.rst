Path3D
======

**Inherits:** :ref:`Node3D<class_Node3D>` **<** :ref:`Node<class_Node>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

Contains a :ref:`Curve3D<class_Curve3D>` path for :ref:`PathFollow3D<class_PathFollow3D>` nodes to follow.

.. rst-class:: classref-introduction-group

Description
-----------

Can have :ref:`PathFollow3D<class_PathFollow3D>` child nodes moving along the :ref:`Curve3D<class_Curve3D>`. See :ref:`PathFollow3D<class_PathFollow3D>` for more information on the usage.

Note that the path is considered as relative to the moved nodes (children of :ref:`PathFollow3D<class_PathFollow3D>`). As such, the curve should usually start with a zero vector ``(0, 0, 0)``.
