Description
-----------

Concave polygon 2D shape resource for physics. It is made out of segments and is very optimal for complex polygonal concave collisions. It is really not advised to use for :ref:`RigidBody2D<class_rigidbody2d>` nodes. A CollisionPolygon2D in convex decomposition mode (solids) or several convex objects are advised for that instead. Otherwise, a concave polygon 2D shape is better for static collisions.

The main difference between a :ref:`ConvexPolygonShape2D<class_convexpolygonshape2d>` and a ``ConcavePolygonShape2D`` is that a concave polygon assumes it is concave and uses a more complex method of collision detection, and a convex one forces itself to be convex in order to speed up collision detection.
