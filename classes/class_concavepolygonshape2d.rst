ConcavePolygonShape2D
=====================

**Inherits:** :ref:`Shape2D<class_Shape2D>` **<** :ref:`Resource<class_Resource>` **<** :ref:`Reference<class_Reference>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

Concave polygon 2D shape resource for physics.

.. rst-class:: classref-introduction-group

Description
-----------

Concave polygon 2D shape resource for physics. It is made out of segments and is optimal for complex polygonal concave collisions. However, it is not advised to use for :ref:`RigidBody2D<class_RigidBody2D>` nodes. A CollisionPolygon2D in convex decomposition mode (solids) or several convex objects are advised for that instead. Otherwise, a concave polygon 2D shape is better for static collisions.

The main difference between a :ref:`ConvexPolygonShape2D<class_ConvexPolygonShape2D>` and a **ConcavePolygonShape2D** is that a concave polygon assumes it is concave and uses a more complex method of collision detection, and a convex one forces itself to be convex in order to speed up collision detection.

\ **Warning:** Using this shape for an :ref:`Area2D<class_Area2D>` (via a :ref:`CollisionShape2D<class_CollisionShape2D>` node) may give unexpected results: the area will only detect collisions with the segments in the **ConcavePolygonShape2D** (and not with any "inside" of the shape, for example).
