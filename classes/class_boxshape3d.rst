==========

**Inherits:** :ref:`Shape3D<class_Shape3D>` **<** :ref:`Resource<class_Resource>` **<** :ref:`RefCounted<class_RefCounted>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

A 3D box shape used for physics collision.

.. rst-class:: classref-introduction-group

Description
-----------

A 3D box shape, intended for use in physics. Usually used to provide a shape for a :ref:`CollisionShape3D<class_CollisionShape3D>`.

\ **Performance:** **BoxShape3D** is fast to check collisions against. It is faster than :ref:`CapsuleShape3D<class_CapsuleShape3D>` and :ref:`CylinderShape3D<class_CylinderShape3D>`, but slower than :ref:`SphereShape3D<class_SphereShape3D>`.
