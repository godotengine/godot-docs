Building the manual with Sphinx
===============================

This page explains how to build a local copy of the Godot manual using the
Sphinx docs engine. This allows you to have local HTML files and build the
documentation as a PDF, EPUB, or LaTeX file, for example.

Before you get started, make sure that you have:

- `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_
- `make <https://www.gnu.org/software/make/>`_ (unless you're using Windows)
- `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ 3

.. note:: Python 3 should come with the ``pip3`` command. You may need to write
    ``python3 -m pip`` (Unix) or  ``py -m pip`` (Windows) instead of ``pip3``.
    If both approaches fail, `make sure that you have pip3 installed
    <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/>`__.

1.  *(Optional)* Set up a virtual environment. Virtual environments prevent
    potential conflicts between the Python packages in ``requirements.txt`` and
    other Python packages that are installed on your system.

    a.  Create the virtual environment:

        .. tabs::

            .. group-tab:: Windows

                .. code:: pwsh

                    py -m venv godot-docs-venv

            .. group-tab:: Other platforms

                .. code:: sh

                    python3 -m venv godot-docs-venv

    b.  Activate the virtual environment:

        .. tabs::

            .. group-tab:: Windows

                .. code:: pwsh

                    godot-docs-venv\Scripts\activate.bat

            .. group-tab:: Other platforms

                .. code:: sh

                    source godot-docs-venv/bin/activate

    c.  *(Optional)* Update pre-installed packages:

        .. tabs::

            .. group-tab:: Windows

                .. code:: pwsh

                    py -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

            .. group-tab:: Other platforms

                .. code:: sh

                    pip3 install --upgrade pip setuptools

2.  Clone the docs repo:

    .. code:: sh

        git clone https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs.git

3.  Change directory into the docs repo:

    .. code:: sh

        cd godot-docs

4.  Install the required packages:

    .. code:: sh

        pip3 install -r requirements.txt

5.  Build the docs:

    .. code:: sh

        make html

    .. note::
        On Windows, that command will run ``make.bat`` instead of GNU Make (or an alternative).

    Alternatively, you can build the documentation by running the sphinx-build program manually:

    .. code:: sh

        sphinx-build -b html ./ _build/html

The compilation will take some time as the ``classes/`` folder contains hundreds of files.
See :ref:`doc_building_the_manual:performance`.

You can then browse the documentation by opening ``_build/html/index.html`` in
your web browser.

Dealing with errors
-------------------

If you run into errors, you may try the following command:

.. code:: sh

    make SPHINXBUILD=~/.local/bin/sphinx-build html

If you get a ``MemoryError`` or ``EOFError``, you can remove the ``classes/`` folder and
run ``make`` again.
This will drop the class references from the final HTML documentation, but will keep the
rest intact.

.. important::
    If you delete the ``classes/`` folder, do not use ``git add .`` when working on a pull
    request or the whole ``classes/`` folder will be removed when you commit.
    See `#3157 <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs/issues/3157>`__ for more detail.

Hints for performance
---------------------

RAM usage
^^^^^^^^^

Building the documentation requires at least 8 GB of RAM to run without disk swapping,
which slows it down.
If you have at least 16 GB of RAM, you can speed up compilation by running:

.. tabs::

    .. group-tab:: Windows

        .. code:: pwsh

            set SPHINXOPTS=-j2 && make html

    .. group-tab:: Other platforms

        .. code:: sh

            make html SPHINXOPTS=-j2

You can use ``-j auto`` to use all available CPU threads, but this can use a lot
of RAM if you have a lot of CPU threads. For instance, on a system with 32 CPU
threads, ``-j auto`` (which corresponds to ``-j 32`` here) can require 20+ GB of
RAM for Sphinx alone.

Specifying a list of files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can specify a list of files to build, which can greatly speed up compilation:

.. code:: sh

    make html FILELIST='classes/class_node.rst classes/class_resource.rst'
