Using sanitizers
================

What are sanitizers?
--------------------

Sanitizers are static instrumentation tools that help find bugs that traditional
debuggers usually cannot catch. This is particularly useful when combined with
:ref:`doc_unit_testing` in continuous integration.

Sanitizers can be used on Windows, macOS and Linux by using the Clang (LLVM),
GCC or Visual Studio compilers.
:ref:`Certain platforms <doc_using_sanitizers_platform_specific_sanitizers>`
may also have their own sanitizers available.
In situations where a single sanitizer is provided by several different compilers,
remember that their output and behavior will differ slightly.

Using sanitizers on Godot
-------------------------

Sanitizers **require** recompiling the binary. This means you cannot use
official Godot binaries to run sanitizers.

When :ref:`compiling <toc-devel-compiling>` with any of the sanitizers enabled,
the resulting binary will have the ``.san`` suffix added to its name to
distinguish it from a binary without sanitizers.

There is a performance impact as many additional runtime checks need to be
performed. Memory utilization will also increase. It is possible to enable
certain combinations of multiple sanitizers in a single build. Beware of the
performance impact when using multiple sanitizers at once though, as the
resulting binary may be excessively slow.

Certain options can be passed to sanitizers without having to recompile the
binary using environment variables.

.. _doc_using_sanitizers_address_sanitizer:

Address sanitizer (ASAN)
------------------------

- Available in Clang and GCC.
- **Supported platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows (Visual Studio), Web
- `Clang ASAN documentation <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html>`__

The address sanitizer is generally the most frequently used sanitizer. It can
diagnose issues such as buffer overruns and out-of-bounds access. If the engine
crashes with a message such as ``free(): invalid pointer``, this is typically
the result of a buffer overrun. (This message is printed by the C runtime, not
Godot.)

In certain situations (such as detecting uninitialized memory reads),
the address sanitizer doesn't suffice. The :ref:`doc_using_sanitizers_memory_sanitizer`
should be used instead.

It is also possible to detect use-after-return situations by specifying the
``ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_stack_use_after_return=1`` environment variable before
*running* Godot (not when compiling it). This increases the address sanitizer's
runtime overhead, so only enable this feature when you actually need it.

To enable the address sanitizer in a Godot build, pass the ``use_asan=yes``
SCons option when compiling. Enabling ASAN generally makes the resulting binary
about 2× slower.

.. warning::

    Due to a `design decision
    <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36971902/why-cant-clang-enable-all-sanitizers/>`__,
    the address, memory and thread sanitizers are mutually exclusive. This means
    you can only use one of those sanitizers in a given binary.

Leak sanitizer (LSAN)
---------------------

- Available in Clang and GCC.
- **Supported platforms:** Linux, Web
- `Clang LSAN documentation <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LeakSanitizer.html>`__

The leak sanitizer can detect memory leaks, which are situations where memory
that is no longer in use is never freed by the running program. This can
potentially lead to out-of-memory situations if the program runs for long
enough. Since Godot may run on
:ref:`dedicated servers <doc_exporting_for_dedicated_servers>` for months or
even years without a restart, it's important to fix memory leaks when they occur.

To enable the leak sanitizer in a Godot build, pass the ``use_lsan=yes`` SCons
option when compiling. Enabling LSAN only has a small performance overhead, but
the program will be much slower to exit as leak detection occurs when the
program exits.

.. _doc_using_sanitizers_memory_sanitizer:

Memory sanitizer (MSAN)
-----------------------

- Available in Clang only, not GCC.
- **Supported platforms:** Linux
- `Clang MSAN documentation <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/MemorySanitizer.html>`__

The memory sanitizer complements the
:ref:`doc_using_sanitizers_address_sanitizer`. Unlike the address sanitizer,
the memory sanitizer can detect uninitialized memory reads.

To enable the memory sanitizer in a Godot build, pass the ``use_msan=yes``
SCons option when compiling. Enabling MSAN generally makes the resulting binary
about 3× slower.

.. warning::

    Due to a `design decision
    <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36971902/why-cant-clang-enable-all-sanitizers/>`__,
    the address, memory and thread sanitizers are mutually exclusive. This means
    you can only use one of those sanitizers in a given binary.

Thread sanitizer (TSAN)
-----------------------

- Available in Clang and GCC.
- **Supported platforms:** Linux, macOS
- `Clang TSAN documentation <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSanitizer.html>`__

The thread sanitizer is used to track down race conditions related to
multithreading. A race condition is when multiple threads try to modify the same
data at the same time. Since thread scheduling can be ordered in any fashion by
the operating system, this leads to incorrect behavior that only occurs
occasionally (and can be difficult to track as a result). To prevent a race
condition, you need to add a lock to ensure only one thread can access the
shared data at a given time.

To enable the thread sanitizer in a Godot build, pass the ``use_tsan=yes`` SCons
option when compiling. Enabling TSAN generally makes the resulting binary 10×
slower, while also multiplying memory usage by an approximately 8× factor.

.. warning::

    Due to a `design decision
    <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36971902/why-cant-clang-enable-all-sanitizers/>`__,
    the address, memory and thread sanitizers are mutually exclusive. This means
    you can only use one of those sanitizers in a given binary.

.. note::

    On Linux, if you stumble upon the following error:

    ``FATAL: ThreadSanitizer: unexpected memory mapping``

    You may need to temporarily lower the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) entropy in your system with:

    .. code:: sh

        sudo sysctl vm.mmap_rnd_bits=28

    Or preferably disable it entirely with:

    .. code:: sh

        sudo sysctl kernel.randomize_va_space=0

    And as soon as you are done with the thread sanitizer, increase the ASLR entropy with:

    .. code:: sh

        sudo sysctl vm.mmap_rnd_bits=32

    Or re-enable ASLR with:

    .. code:: sh

        sudo sysctl kernel.randomize_va_space=2

    Rebooting your machine will also revert the ASLR state to its default values.

    It's important to revert the changes as soon as possible because lowering the ASLR entropy or disabling ASLR entirely can be a security risk.

Undefined behavior sanitizer (UBSAN)
------------------------------------

- Available in Clang and GCC.
- **Supported platforms:** Linux, macOS, Web
- `Clang UBSAN documentation <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html>`__

The undefined behavior sanitizer is used to track down situations where the
program exhibits random and unpredictable behavior. This is due to C/C++ code
that is accepted by the compiler, but is not *correct*. Compiling with a
different set of optimizations can also change the observed results of undefined
behavior.

To enable the undefined behavior sanitizer in a Godot build, pass the
``use_ubsan=yes`` SCons option when compiling. Enabling UBSAN only has a small
performance overhead.

.. _doc_using_sanitizers_platform_specific_sanitizers:

Platform-specific sanitizers
----------------------------

Web
^^^

When :ref:`compiling for the Web <doc_compiling_for_web>`,
there are 2 additional sanitizer SCons options available:

- ``use_assertions=yes`` enables runtime Emscripten assertions, which can catch
  various issues.
- ``use_safe_heap=yes`` enables `Emscripten's SAFE_HEAP sanitizer <https://emscripten.org/docs/debugging/Sanitizers.html>`__.
  It provides similar functionality to ASAN, but it focuses on issues that
  are specific to WebAssembly. ``SAFE_HEAP`` is not guaranteed to be compatible
  with ASAN and UBSAN in the same binary, so you may have to build it separately.
